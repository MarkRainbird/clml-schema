                <Text>Section 29, Finance Act 1970 governs the taxation of royalties receivable on or after 6th April 1970 under a mineral lease or agreement, and empowers the Commissioners of Inland Revenue to make provision by regulations as to the extent to which payments under a mineral lease or agreement are to be treated for this purpose as royalties if they relate to other matters besides the winning and working of minerals. These regulations make such provision.</Text>
