        <Text>Some bodies within the business, charity and voluntary sectors are employers within the Local Government Pension Scheme. There will be costs in public service pension schemes from extending survivor benefits to include civil partners. A Regulatory Impact Assessment was published alongside the Civil Partnership Act 2004, which assesses the impact of the Act on the business, charity and voluntary sectors, and outlines the cost implications to public service pension schemes. Accordingly, a separate Regulatory Impact Assessment was not produced for these Regulations. The final Regulatory Impact Assessment for the Civil Partnership Act 2004 has been placed in the library of each House of Parliament and can be viewed at <ExternalLink Title="DTI website" URI="http://www.dti.gov.uk/access/ria/index.htm#equality" id="i00000">http://www.dti.gov.uk/access/ria/index.htm#equality</ExternalLink>.</Text>
