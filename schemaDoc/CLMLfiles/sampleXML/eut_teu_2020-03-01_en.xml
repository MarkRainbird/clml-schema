                                       <Emphasis>It results from the case-law of the Court of Justice that primacy of EC law is a cornerstone principle of Community law.

At the time of the first judgment of this established case law (Costa/ENEL,15 July 1964, Case 6/641</Emphasis>
                                       <FootnoteRef Ref="f00006"/>) <Emphasis>there was no mention of primacy in the treaty. It is still the case today.
