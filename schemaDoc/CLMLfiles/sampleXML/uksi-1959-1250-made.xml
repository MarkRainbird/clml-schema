      <dc:description>These regulations amend the Local Government Superannuation (England and Scotland) Regulations, 1948 (which regulate the superannuation rights of persons who having been in superannuable Local Government employment in England move to superannuable Local Government employment in Scotland and the corresponding rights of persons who move from Scotland to England). The amendments are consequential on the Local Government Superannuation Act, 1953 and provide for the reckoning of qualifying service (i.e. service reckonable for the purpose of determining a person's right to superannuation benefits but not for calculating the amount of the benefits) and additional years of service which may now be granted to certain persons with special professional or other qualifications (regulations 4 and 8); for the continuation of payments made as a condition of reckoning non-contributing service as contributing service (regulations 5 and 9); and for the rights of certain re-employed pensioners (regulations 6, 7, 10 and 11).</dc:description>

         <Title>EXPLANATORY NOTE</Title>
         <P>
            <Text>These regulations amend the Local Government Superannuation (England and Scotland) Regulations, 1948 (which regulate the superannuation rights of persons who having been in superannuable Local Government employment in England move to superannuable Local Government employment in Scotland and the corresponding rights of persons who move from Scotland to England). The amendments are consequential on the Local Government Superannuation Act, 1953 and provide for the reckoning of qualifying service (i.e. service reckonable for the purpose of determining a person's right to superannuation benefits but not for calculating the amount of the benefits) and additional years of service which may now be granted to certain persons with special professional or other qualifications (regulations 4 and 8); for the continuation of payments made as a condition of reckoning non-contributing service as contributing service (regulations 5 and 9); and for the rights of certain re-employed pensioners (regulations 6, 7, 10 and 11).</Text>
