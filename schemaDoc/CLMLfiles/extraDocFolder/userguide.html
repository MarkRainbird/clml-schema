    NOTE TO THOSE EDITING THIS DOCUMENT:
    To ensure correct and consistent presentation of the User Guide, please ensure that you do the following:
      1. You must use <h2> for top level headings, <h3> for the next level, <h4> <h5> etc. 
         Otherwise, the ToC will be indented incorrectly.
      2. You must put content within <div class="section"> elements.
         The heading must be a child of a <div class="section"> or it will not show in the ToC.
      3. If you put a heading *anywhere* as a child of a <div class="section"> it will show up on the ToC,
         which is not what you want. Create a new child <div class="section"> with the heading as its first
         child instead.
      4. To link to a section, lower-case its title, remove any punctuation except dashes and replace all
         dashes and spaces with hyphens, then prepend a # (e.g. Appendix B—Implied Punctuation becomes
         #appendix-b-implied-punctuation). If that doesn't link to the right section, apply the same rules
         to the parent section's title then prepend it with a following hyphen.
      5. Example images should have class="output" set on them. When creating the image, it should have a 
         20px white border around the content.

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>This schema describes the Crown Legislation Markup Language (CLML). CLML is a dialect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> that can describe legislation published by UK national governments and legislatures, as well as legislation originating from the European Union. The schema is suitable for both print and web publication of legislation, as well as for use in editorial applications (that is, it is intended that editors may directly edit the XML to produce revised versions of legislation).</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The Legislation Schema (also known as the CLML schema, for Crown Legislation Markup Language) specifies a document structure that can comprehensively represent:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>United Kingdom primary and secondary legislation;</li>
          <li>Legislation originating from the European Union.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Scope and objectives</h3>
        <p>The primary objectives for the design of the schema are as follows:</p>
        <strong>Expressivity:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The schema should be able to describe all existing UK legislation data (within reason), along with any relevant metadata.</li>
          <li>The schema should be able to describe all EU regulations, decisions, directives and treaties, along with any relevant metadata, to allow for the publication of EU legislation (see the section below on <a href="#eu-legislation">EU legislation</a>).</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Versatility:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The schema should enable the typesetting of documents that use the schema.</li>
          <li>The schema should allow fragmentation of the data, to enable a user to view or edit a subsection of the document.</li>
          <li>The schema should allow documents to use the functionality of hypermedia, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a> and hyperlinking on websites.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Modularity and standardisation:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>The schema should use a modular approach where appropriate, to enable reuse or replacement of individual schema modules (for example, the schema has different profiles for Publishing, Editorial and the website, each of which specify different constraints on allowable content).</li>
          <li>The schema should conform to recognized standards wherever practicable (e.g. W3 recommendations and UK Government schema guidelines).</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Applications</h4>
          <p>The schema is designed to support the use of legislation XML in the following applications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Print publication of enacted and made legislation;</li>
            <li>Web publication of enacted/made and revised legislation;</li>
            <li>Editorial update of and corrections to legislation data, including “fragments” of a legislation document.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Originally, there were separate versions of the schema for web publication, print publication and editorial applications. As of version 2 of the schema, we have combined the modules and features from these versions into a single “unified” schema that is shared across all applications.</p>
          <p>In future, we plan to create multiple “application profiles” of the schema. The unified schema will contain an alternative top-level schema file for each application profile, which will impose alternative validation requirements for specific applications. Currently, the only profiles are the main “legislation” profile and the “fragment” profile for editorial update, which provides a new <code>&lt;Fragment&gt;</code> top-level element and other structures specific to the editorial environment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Limitations</h4>
          <div class="section">
            <h5>Amendments</h5>
            <p>Legislation often contains amendments to other legislation. The schema allows the drafter to mark up text as <em>amendment text</em> (that is, to indicate the marked-up text is to be inserted or substituted into another provision), but does not support describing the target or the action of the effect in a machine-readable format within the text. We do, however, separately support the representation of the target and action of amendments as <a href="#effects">effects</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the following figure shows two amendments made by one item of legislation to another:</p>
            <p><img src="img/ug1.png" alt="(g) after Schedule 2 there shall be inserted the contents of the Schedule to these Regulations; and (h) in Schedule 2 (Amendments of Acts and Orders) paragraph 4(2)(b) shall be omitted." class="output"/></p>
            
            <p>In the case of provision (g) above, the textual content of the new Schedule that the amendment inserts would normally be marked up as a “block amendment” (see the <a href="#part-4-semantic-mark-up-amendments">Amendments</a> section), but in the case of provision (h), where there is no text to be inserted or substituted, the amendment would not be marked up at all. No other metadata about the amendments may be included inline, but as noted above, an editor may separately record metadata for each amendment (its origin, target, action, date of coming into force and other details) as an effect.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h5>Legal meaning of texts</h5>
            <p>The schema describes the structure of a legislation document, but does not attempt to describe the legal meaning behind the document. There are other projects, such as <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/legalruleml/">LegalRuleML</a> and <a href="https://catala-lang.org/">Catala</a>, that attempt to encode legal statements in a machine-readable format.</p>

        <h3>Terminology used in this document</h3>
        <p>This documentation uses the following definitions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“The schema” means the legislation schema;</li>
          <li>A reference to a “chapter” number also includes measure numbers for Church Measures.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Schema documentation</h3>
        <p>Wherever possible, the schema includes inline documentation within each of its components, to make it easier to consult the documentation and keep it up to date.</p>
        <p>The documentation explaining the meaning of each element and attribute, and the content that is allowed to be present within them, can be found in the <a href="reference.html" target="_top">Schema Reference Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>This documentation (the user guide) is intended to provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Background information about the schema;</li>
          <li>Further information and guidance on major structures and elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> where a diagram of an element is provided in this document (or in the reference guide), it should be possible to click on an element or attribute in that diagram and navigate to the detailed information in the <a href="reference.html" target="_top">Schema Reference Guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Sample files</h3>
        <!-- PA 16/5/2023 - currently no plan for how to distribute sample files - commenting this out until we do have one
          (it will probably involve building a ZIP file from the repo and uploading it to Github)
        <p>The schema and reference guide come with a set of sample files. These files are a mixture of the following types of CLML document:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“print” CLML documents, as generated by our Publishing system;</li>
          <li>EU CLML documents, as originally transformed from the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/formex">Formex</a> XML format;</li>
          <li><a href="#part-6-the-revised-and-website-content-models">“web” CLML documents</a>, as generated by the legislation.gov.uk website;</li>
          <li>editorial “fragment” CLML documents, which use the <a href="#part-7-editing-legislation-in-the-fragment-schema">fragment schema</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where this documentation includes an excerpt from a CLML or PDF document, we have provided a reference to the file containing that document to assist with further analysis. Additionally, where the  document is available as XML on legislation.gov.uk, we have provided a link to the document.</p>-->
        <p>The user guide includes numerous examples of the use of CLML in legislation documents. Where this guide includes an excerpt from a legislation document, and the document is available as XML on legislation.gov.uk, the example will include a link to that document as XML.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Tool support</h3>
        <p>The legislation schema attempts to represent the structure of legislation in great detail and is consequently very complex. As a result, some tools and processors may not correctly interpret the schema, even though it is valid and compliant with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">XML Schema specification</a>.</p>
        <p>The latest version of the following popular tools and processors support validation using the schema:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.saxonica.com/">Saxon EE</a></li>
          <li>.NET (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.xml"><code>System.Xml</code></a>)</li>

      <h2>Part 1—Design</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Top-level schemas</h3>
        <p>The schema has the following top-level schemas that can be used to validate legislation documents:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>legislation.xsd—used to validate primary and secondary UK legislation and legislation originating from the EU, including that available from <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/">legislation.gov.uk</a> and from the <a href="http://leggovuk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com">bulk downloads site</a>, as well as data held within the legislation.gov.uk platform.</li>
          <li>fragment.xsd—used to validate fragments of legislation during the editing process. This schema has a root element of <code>&lt;Fragment&gt;</code> (rather than <code>&lt;Legislation&gt;</code>) and re-uses the content models from legislation.xsd in a more flexible way.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following schema modules are not currently used for new data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>en.xsd—used to validate explanatory notes and explanatory memoranda. (Note that government departments now normally deliver Explanatory Notes in a Markdown format that is then converted to HTML)</li>
          <li>impactAssessment.xsd—originally intended to validate UK Impact Assessments delivered as XML, but never used for data on legislation.gov.uk.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This documentation focuses on the legislation.xsd top-level schema, whose <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/schema/legislation.xsd">latest release</a> is available on legislation.gov.uk. The fragment schema re-uses most of the features of the legislation schema but has some important differences, which the part on the <a href="#part-7-editing-legislation-in-the-fragment-schema">fragment schema</a> details.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Modular approach</h3>
        <p>The legislation schema uses a modular approach. The modules are of three different types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Legislation-specific (those that describe structures specific to legislation)</li>
          <li>Generic</li>
          <li>Off-the-shelf</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We intend to re-use existing standards wherever possible to develop legislation.gov.uk and its components, including the legislation schema. The schema uses the following “off-the-shelf” modules, with minor adaptations to some of the modules to support our in-house tools:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a> (for mathematical formulae)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a> (for metadata)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">Atom</a> (for internal links to other versions or related resources of a document)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/">XHTML</a> (for tables and Atom feeds)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">XML namespace</a> (for attributes relating to language and whitespace)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A secondary objective was to create generic modules for features that could be used for other content we publish, such as explanatory notes. Legislation and its associated documents are highly structured with similar content models, and share many common elements such as paragraphs, tables, lists, footnotes and hyperlinks, so the schema provides these in modules that the top-level schemas reuse.</p>
        <p>A list of modules can be found in the Table of Contents in the <a href="reference.html" target="_top">Schema Reference Guide</a> (group by “Location” or navigate through each file by selecting “resource hierarchy”).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Paragraph model</h3>
        <p>The schema models a paragraph as a modular entity built up of items of text, lists, tables and so on. In this model, the items of which the paragraph is built <em>belong</em> to the paragraph. This is different to, for instance, HTML, which uses the “sibling-blocks” model—that is, structures such as lists do not belong to the paragraph.</p>
        <p>The schema paragraph model gives us paragraphs structured as in the following example:</p>
        <img src="img/ug1a.png" alt="“emergency services” include—(a) police, fire, rescue and ambulance services; (b) Her Majesty’s Coastguard; " class="output"/>
        <ci:include href="uksi_20051643_en.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Secondary/*:Body//*:P2[@id='p00071']/*:P2para[1]/*:UnorderedList[1]/*:ListItem[2]/*:Para[1]" fileref="uksi_20051643_en" source="example"/>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Namespaces</h3>
        <p>Each XML element and attribute has a name. This name consists of the <em>local name</em> (for example, <code>img</code> or <code>src</code>) and optionally a <em>namespace</em>, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URI</a> (for example, <code>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/namespaces/legislation</code>). A namespace distinguishes elements or attributes with the same local name from one another, which is useful where a single XML schema or document combines elements or attributes from multiple modules or organisations.
          </p>
        <p>A namespace URI need not have any special meaning, or even be possible for the processing application to resolve—it simply serves to be a globally unique identifier for the namespace, and can also imply “ownership” of a data model that uses the namespace (as opposed to the data itself) by a particular person or organisation.</p>
        <p>An XML document can apply a namespace directly to an element using the <code>xmlns</code> attribute on that element (for example, <code>&lt;Citation xmlns="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/namespaces/legislation"&gt;</code>). This indicates that the <code>&lt;Citation&gt;</code> element is in the <code>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/namespaces/legislation</code> namespace.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, an XML document can apply a namespace to an element or attribute by defining a <em>prefix</em> on an element (for example, one can define the <code>xs:</code> prefix as denoting the XML Schema namespace by adding the attribute <code>xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"</code> to an element), which makes the namespace available for use on that element or any of its attributes or child nodes.</p>
        <p>In the legislation schema, namespaces help to distinguish elements and attributes from different modules and schemas. For example, <code>leg:Correction</code> and <code>ukm:Correction</code> both have the same “local” name (<code>Correction</code>), but exist in different namespaces (<code>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/namespaces/legislation</code> for <code>leg:Correction</code> and <code>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/namespaces/metadata</code> for <code>ukm:Correction</code>) and appear as different types of element to an XML processor.</p>
        <p>The default namespace for the schema is <code>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/namespaces/legislation</code>. Normally legislation documents use this namespace without a prefix, but in contexts where a prefix is used the normal prefix is <code>leg:</code>.</p>
        <p>The schema uses other namespaces, including (but not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/namespaces/metadata</code>—for legislation metadata (normally using the prefix <code>ukm:</code>);</li>
          <li><code>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</code>—for Dublin Core metadata (normally using the prefix <code>dc:</code>);</li>
          <li><code>http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom</code>—for Atom format links to resources (normally using the prefix <code>atom:</code>);</li>
          <li><code>http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML</code>—For MathML mathematical content (normally using the prefix <code>m:</code>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A list of namespaces can be found in the Table of Contents in the <a href="reference.html" target="_top">Schema Reference Guide</a> (group by “Namespace”).</p>

        <h3>EU legislation</h3>
        <p>In 2019, legislation.gov.uk began to publish EU legislation, in order to fulfil the obligations of the Queen’s Printer under <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2018/16/schedule/5">Schedule 5 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018</a>. We now publish all EU regulations, decisions and directives as they stood at the end of the Brexit implementation period.</p>
        <p>The EU legislation on legislation.gov.uk originally comes from <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/homepage.html">EUR-Lex</a>, the EU legislation website operated by the Publications Office of the EU. Where legislation is available on EUR-Lex as XML, we have converted it into CLML before uploading it to legislation.gov.uk. We have extended the schema to support structures and metadata specific to EU legislation.</p>
        <p>For more information on EU law following the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, please see the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eu-legislation-and-uk-law">EU legislation and UK law</a> page on legislation.gov.uk.</p>

      <h2>Part 2—The core content model</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>High-level document structure</h3>
        <p>The root element of a legislation document consists of a <code>&lt;Legislation&gt;</code> element. Within this element, the following structures can occur:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#part-5-metadata">Metadata</a> (the <code>&lt;ukm:Metadata&gt;</code> element)</li>
          <li><a href="#tables-of-contents">Tables of contents</a> (the <code>&lt;Contents&gt;</code> element</li>
          <li>The <a href="#the-high-level-class-container">high-level class container</a> (the <code>&lt;Primary&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Secondary&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;EURetained&gt;</code> element)</li>
          <li><a href="#footnotes">Footnotes</a> (the <code>&lt;Footnotes&gt;</code> element)</li>
          <li><a href="#margin-notes">Margin notes</a> (the <code>&lt;MarginNotes&gt;</code> element)</li>
          <li><a href="#versions">Versions</a> (the <code>&lt;Versions&gt;</code> element)</li>
          <li><a href="#resources">Resources</a> (the <code>&lt;Resources&gt;</code> element)</li>
          <li><a href="#commentaries">Commentaries</a> (the <code>&lt;Commentaries&gt;</code> element)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The root element also permits citation lists (the <code>&lt;CitationLists&gt;</code> element), but these are defunct and no longer used in CLML.</p>
        <p>All of these are detailed in the following sections or in the <a href="reference.html" target="_top">Schema Reference Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>The schema treats footnotes, margin notes, versions and resources as out-of-line constructs—that is, they are separate from the main flow of the content and are referenced from that content. The main reasons for this approach are that the content may reference the items in these constructs more than once, and by removing them from the main content it allows the main content to flow more easily.</p>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>The high-level class container</h4>
          <p><code>&lt;Primary&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Secondary&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;EURetained&gt;</code> elements describe the content that can occur in primary and secondary legislation and legislation originating from the EU. The structure of each is very similiar and consists of the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#preliminary-matter">Preliminary matter</a> (<code>&lt;PrimaryPrelims&gt;</code> for primary legislation, <code>&lt;SecondaryPrelims&gt;</code> for secondary legislation and <code>&lt;EUPrelims&gt;</code> for legislation from the European Union)</li>
            <li>The body of the document (the <code>&lt;Body&gt;</code> element for UK legislation or <code>&lt;EUBody&gt;</code> for European Union legislation)</li>
            <li><a href="#appendices">Appendices</a> (the <code>&lt;Appendix&gt;</code> element&#8212;these are only available for primary and secondary legislation, and are only used by secondary legislation)</li>
            <li><a href="#schedules-and-annexes">Schedules</a> (the <code>&lt;Schedules&gt;</code> element)</li>
            <li><a href="#attachments">Attachments</a> (the <code>&lt;Attachments&gt;</code> element&#8212;this is only available for EU legislation)</li>
            <li><a href="#explanatory-notes">Explanatory notes</a> (the <code>&lt;ExplanatoryNotes&gt;</code> element&#8212;this is only available for primary and secondary legislation, and is only used by secondary legislation)</li>
            <li><a href="#earlier-orders">Earlier orders</a> (the <code>&lt;EarlierOrders&gt;</code> element&#8212;this is only available for secondary legislation)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Again, each of these is explained in detail on the following sections or in the <a href="reference.html" target="_top">Schema Reference Guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Preliminary matter</h3>
        <p>The preliminary matter for primary and secondary legislation differs enough that the decision was taken to create separate mark-up for each. The preliminary matter for EU legislation also differs greatly from UK legislation, and so it too has its own structure to represent it.</p>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Primary preliminary matter</h4>
          <p>The preliminary matter for primary legislation has the following structures:</p>

          <p>The following is a fairly standard example of primary preliminary matter:</p>

          <div class="section">
            <h5>Informal citation</h5>
            <p>This is the short title of the Act combined together with the year. It is marked up using the <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code> element.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h5>Formal citation</h5>
            <p>Although this element is called <code>&lt;Number&gt;</code>, it is actually the formal citation for the document. The content should contain the year of enactment as well as the chapter number. For legislation enacted before 1963, it will contain the regnal year instead of the calendar year.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h5>Long title</h5>
            <p>This is the full title of the act, generally known as the long title.</p>

            <p>The <code>&lt;PrimaryPreamble&gt;</code> element (see the <a href="schemaLegislationPrelims_xsd.html#PrimaryPreamble">PrimaryPreamble entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>) is a container element that holds the introductory text and enacting text.</p>
            <p>The <code>&lt;IntroductoryText&gt;</code> element is less frequently used now than in the past, but when used generally contains an explanation as to why the Act is being introduced.</p>
            <p>The actual words of enactment are held in the <code>&lt;EnactingText&gt;</code> element. If there is no enacting text (as in the Scottish example above) the <code>&lt;EnactingTextOmitted&gt;</code> element should be used.</p>

              <p>The <code>&lt;Draft&gt;</code> element contains a headnote about the procedure under which the document was laid before Parliament or a devolved legislature. In legacy data, it was also commonly used to indicate that a document corrected an existing document, but the <code>&lt;Correction&gt;</code> element has largely replaced Draft for this purpose (see below).</p>

This element contains the textual description (<code>&lt;Text&gt;</code>) and date (<code>&lt;DateText&gt;</code>) as text elements. The date should match with the <code>&lt;Sifted&gt;</code> date in the secondary metadata.</p>

            <h5>EU titles</h5>
            <p>The titles of EU documents are more complex than those of the short or long titles of UK legislation. EU titles contain multiple lines of text, which normally represent the following information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The type of the document (Regulation, Decision or Directive);</li>
              <li>The EU corporate body, committee or other group responsible for the document (this may appear before or after the type or number, or not at all);</li>
              <li>The date on which the document was adopted (this is not always present in pre-1964 legislation);</li>
              <li>A description of the subject of the document;</li>
              <li>The number of the document (this may appear next to the document type, at the bottom in brackets, or rarely not at all);</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Optionally, the title may also contain one or more of the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For delegated or implementing legislation, the number of the document in which the European Commission notified the Parliament and Council that it has adopted the act (see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/adopting-eu-law/implementing-and-delegated-acts_en">Implementing and delegated acts</a> on the EC website).</li>
              <li>An indication as to which languages of the document had legal authenticity (under <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2018/16/section/3#section-3-4">s. 3(4) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018</a>, only the English version of retained EU law is incorporated into UK law, but other language versions may be used for interpretation);</li>
              <li>An indication that the document has EEA or other treaty relevance;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The schema represents EU titles using the <code>&lt;MultilineTitle&gt;</code> element, which permits one or more <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> elements, each corresponding to a separate line of the title. Below is an example of an EU title:</p>

          <div class="section">
            <h5>EU preamble</h5>
            <p>The <code>&lt;EUPreamble&gt;</code> element describes the preamble of an EU document, which consists of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>citations (references to the legal bases for the act and specific relevant items of legislation, normally beginning with “Having regard to“);</li>
              <li>recitals (a set of numbered statements, preceded by the word “Whereas“, of the reasons for the adoption of the act, as well as certain provisions and procedures relating to its adoption);</li>
              <li>additional text at the start and end to indicate which body or bodies have adopted the act.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Within the preamble, the <code>&lt;Division&gt;</code> element is used to represent the numbered recitals, and the <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> element is used to represent all other paragraphs. An example of an EU preamble appears below:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The <code>&lt;Draft&gt;</code> element only appears in EU documents within <a href="#attachments">attachments</a>. In this context, it normally denotes that the attachment is a draft (for example, the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/eudn/2018/1867/attachment/1">attachment to Council Decision (EU) 2018/1867</a> has the headnote “DRAFT“), but it may instead denote another property of the attachment (for example, the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/eudn/2010/655/attachment/1">attachment to Council Decision 2010/655/EU</a> has the headnote “TRANSLATION“).</li>
              <li>The <code>&lt;IntroductoryText&gt;</code> element appears in some EU Decisions to indicate information that does not conform to the normal preamble.</li>
              <li>The <code>&lt;Number&gt;</code> appears in a very small number of documents to indicate the number of an associated document (e.g. a notifying document).</li>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Headings</h3>
        <p>The schema provides five levels of generic headings, which are sufficient to represent all cross-headings that appear in UK primary and secondary legislation. The following is a list of the heading structures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;Group&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;Part&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;Chapter&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;Pblock&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;PsubBlock&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <code>&lt;Group&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Part&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Chapter&gt;</code> headings correspond to the numbered headings of the same name that appear in the text of legislation. The <code>&lt;Pblock&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;PsubBlock&gt;</code> elements correspond to the two levels of cross-headings that appear in legislation. (The <code>&lt;PsubBlock&gt;</code> level does not tend to occur in primary legislation.)</p>
        <p>The schema enforces a hierarchy for the generic heading elements. Each of the above elements can contain as a child any of the elements below it (except that only a <code>&lt;Pblock&gt;</code> may contain a <code>&lt;PsubBlock&gt;</code>), but it may not contain an instance of the same element or any of the elements above. For example, a <code>&lt;Part&gt;</code> may contain a <code>&lt;Chapter&gt;</code> or a <code>&lt;Pblock&gt;</code>, but not a <code>&lt;Group&gt;</code> or another <code>&lt;Part&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>Each level can contain <code>&lt;Number&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code> elements, although the <code>&lt;Number&gt;</code> element is not always used for all document types. The <code>&lt;Number&gt;</code> element should contain words such as “Part 1”, whilst the <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code> element should contain the text of the heading for the section.</p>
        <p>An example from a Scottish Act is given below:</p>
        <img src="img/ug16.png" alt="Part 1. Access rights. Chapter 1. Nature and extent of access rights. 1 Access rights. (1) Everyone has the statutory rights established by this Part of this Act." class="output"/>

        <!--<p class="fileref">Example taken from asp_200300002_en</p>-->
        <p>In addition, each heading can have a <code>&lt;Reference&gt;</code> element, which is used to list the sections of the document to which the heading relates.</p>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>EU-specific headings</h4>
          <p>EU legislation has a wider variety of headings than UK legislation and the headings in EU documents have different names to those in UK documents. The schema therefore offers a set of EU-specific headings so that it can properly represent EU documents.</p>
          <p>The following is a list of the EU-specific heading structures:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;EUPart&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;EUTitle&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;EUChapter&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;EUSection&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;EUSubsection&gt;</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;Division&gt;</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The <code>&lt;EU&gt;</code>-prefixed heading elements correspond to the numbered headings of the same name that appear in EU legislation. The <code>&lt;Division&gt;</code> element is used to represent headings that do not correspond to any of the other EU-specific heading elements (such as numbered headings with no name), and it appears widely in EU legislation. EU documents may also use <code>&lt;Pblock&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;PsubBlock&gt;</code>, but not any of the other generic headings.</p>
          <p>Unlike UK documents, for which the schema enforces a strict hierarchy for headings, EU documents may contain headings in any nesting order. The EU’s body of law is much larger and less consistent than that of the UK, and so the schema must enforce only loose constraints so that it can represent all EU legislation.</p>
          <p>An example of a fragment that uses the various types of EU-specific heading appears below:</p>

      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Schedules and annexes</h3>
        <p>For many pieces of legislation, the schedules form the major part of the document, and generally provide the detail to content described in the body of the document. The <code>&lt;Schedules&gt;</code> section (see the entry in the <a href="schemaLegislationMain_xsd.html#Schedules">Reference Guide</a>) follows on from the <code>&lt;Body&gt;</code> element and has a structure as shown below:.</p>
        <ci:include href="schemaLegislationMain_xsd.html" xpath="cm:getImageFromTitle(.,'Schedules')"/>
        <p>Abstracts, signed sections (signatures), attachments and appendices are described elsewhere in this document. There may be an appendix to all the schedules, in which case it should be part of the <code>&lt;Schedules&gt;</code> element and occur after the schedules or, alternatively, it may be an appendix, in which case it should be part of a <code>&lt;Schedule&gt;</code> element.</p>
        <ci:include href="schemaLegislationMain_xsd.html" xpath="cm:getImageFromTitle(.,'Schedule')"/>
        <p>The <code>&lt;Number&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code> elements should hold the schedule number and title respectively.</p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;Reference&gt;</code> element is used to list the sections of the document to which the schedule relates.</p>
        <p>Introductory text can, sometimes, occur between the schedule title and the table of contents of the schedule (if one occurs). The <code>&lt;IntroductoryText&gt;</code> element can be used to contain this text.</p>
        <p>The following is an excellent example, where a schedule is amending a schedule and both contain <code>&lt;Reference&gt;</code> elements:</p>
        <img src="img/ug18.png" alt="SCHEDULE. Regulation 16. SCHEDULE 3. FEES FOR ADVOCACY IN THE CROWN COURT. Regulations 6(2C), 9(2A)" class="output"/>

        <p>EU documents have “annexes”, rather than schedules, but these also use the <code>&lt;Schedule&gt;</code> element. (However, when an EU document has an attached document, it normally appears in an <a href="#attachments">attachment</a> rather than in a schedule.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Attachments</h3>
        <p>The <code>&lt;Attachment&gt;</code> element describes a document attached to an EU document. An attachment contains a <a href="#the-high-level-class-container">high-level class container</a> element (<code>&lt;EURetained&gt;</code> for EU documents), and so can use the full content model of a normal document, including preliminary matter, annexes and attachments. The <code>&lt;Attachment&gt;</code> element may currently only appear in an EU document.</p>
        <p>An example of an attachment appears below:</p>

        <p>The legislation.gov.uk website does not support navigating to provisions within attachments, and so does the descendant elements of an <code>&lt;Attachment&gt;</code> element should not have structural IDs or URIs.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Provisions and paragraphs</h3>
        <p>The main body of an item of modern legislation consists of numbered paragraphs. (Older legislation, particularly that enacted before 1600, often does not contain numbered paragraphs.)</p>
        <p>There are seven levels of numbered paragraphs in the schema, with element names of <code>&lt;P1&gt;</code>–<code>&lt;P7&gt;</code> (see the <a href="schemaLegislationNumberedSections_xsd.html#P1">P1 entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>). The level that should be used should reflect the structural level that is required. The following guidelines should indicate the level to use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A numbered paragraph that is a direct child of the body, a heading element or a <code>&lt;P1group&gt;</code> (see below) must be a <code>&lt;P1&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li>A numbered paragraph that is a direct child of a <code>&lt;P1&gt;</code>’s <code>&lt;P1para&gt;</code> element: <ul>
              <li>should normally be a <code>&lt;P2&gt;</code> if its number uses Arabic numerals (1-9), even if the number also uses letters (e.g. 2A); or</li>
              <li>should normally be a <code>&lt;P3&gt;</code> if its number uses letters only (a-z).</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>A numbered paragraph that is a child of a <code>&lt;P2para&gt;</code> or a lower level should normally be of the next level down (for example, numbered paragraphs within a <code>&lt;P3para&gt;</code> should normally use the <code>&lt;P4&gt;</code> element).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each numbered level must contain a <code>&lt;Pnumber&gt;</code> element that contains the number of the paragraph. Normally, a document should not include punctuation for the number, as this is implied formatting. However, if an author needs to specify non-standard punctuation, they can use the attributes <code>PuncBefore</code> and <code>PuncAfter</code> to specify punctuation occurring before or after the number. The below example uses these attributes to replace the brackets that normally surround a <code>&lt;P2&gt;</code> with a trailing full stop:</p>

        <p>In addition to the seven numbered paragraph levels, there is also a <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> element (see the <a href="schemaLegislationNumberedSections_xsd.html#P">P entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>), which represents an unnumbered paragraph. A <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> element must start with some inline content, and after this may contain <code>&lt;P1&gt;</code> children as well as lower levels of paragraph. A <code>&lt;P1group&gt;</code> element may contain <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> children, allowing for a heading to a collection of paragraphs, although this use is rare and discouraged. An example of <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> is given below:</p>

          <h4>Paragraph groups and headings</h4>
          <p>In addition to the numbered paragraphs, the schema provides three levels of grouping elements, which allow a heading to be associated with one or more paragraphs. The groups are called <code>&lt;P1group&gt;</code> (see the <a href="schemaLegislationNumberedSections_xsd.html#P1group">P1group entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>), <code>&lt;P2group&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;P3group&gt;</code>. Each grouping must contain a <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code> element, which should hold the heading text. In modern legislation, it is normal for every numbered section in the main body of a document to have its own heading, and in this case each <code>&lt;P1&gt;</code> is wrapped in a <code>&lt;P1group&gt;</code> with the section’s heading.</p>
          <p>There is a <code>Layout</code> attribute that is used in legacy documents to indicate whether the provision number (<code>&lt;Pnumber&gt;</code>) of the first P1 child of a P1group appears beneath (the value ”below“) or to the left of (”side“) the heading of the <code>&lt;P1group&gt;</code>. There is also a rarely used value “default”, which is same as that of having no <code>Layout</code> attribute at all. If no <code>Layout</code> attribute is set or if the value is “default”, an application should render the heading using the implied default for the document type.</p>
          <p>The following examples illustrate how the grouping elements may be used and rendered:</p>

            <h5>Overriding list numbering</h5>
            <p>By default, an application must render the numbers for an ordered list as a consecutive, increasing set, starting from the lowest available number (e.g. 1, a or i) and increasing by one with each list item. However, a document can manually override the number for a whole list using the <code>Start</code> attribute or for an individual list item using the <code>NumberOverride</code> attribute.</p>
            <p>The <code>Start</code> attribute of an <code>&lt;OrderedList&gt;</code> element sets the starting number for the list. This number must always be an integer in Arabic numerals (i.e. 1, 2, 3 etc.) even if the <code>Type</code> is not ”arabic“, so to start a ”roman“ list at ”iii“ the value of <code>Start</code> should be ”3“. An example of the use of the <code>Start</code> parameter appears below—the list is of type “alpha” and <code>Start</code> is set to 5, so the list starts with “(e)”:</p>

            <p>The <code>NumberOverride</code> attribute of a <code>&lt;ListItem&gt;</code> specifies the value that will override the default number value for that list item only. The presence of a <code>NumberOverride</code> attribute on a list item should not affect the numbers of any following list items that do not have a <code>NumberOverride</code> attribute. An example of the use of <code>NumberOverride</code> follows. In this list, the fourth item has the number “ch” and so its <code>NumberOverride</code> value is set to “ch”, and the following item’s <code>NumberOverride</code> is set to “d” to continue the numbering (by default, as the fifth item, it would have a number of “e”):</p>

          <h4>Text and characters</h4>
          <p>Documents using the schema are capable of making full use of the Unicode character set. However, for some characters, when viewing or authoring schema documents, it is difficult to tell what the actual character is. In addition, there are some text effects not possible with Unicode (as they are not actually characters). To deal with both situations the schema has a <code>&lt;Character&gt;</code> element. This allows the following to be marked up:</p>

          <p>It is known that for early legislation using old English that characters may appear that are not in the Unicode set. Rather than add more entries for the <code>&lt;Character&gt;</code> element it is envisaged that the private use area of the Unicode set could be used to cover those characters. However, this is not a trivial task and the work has, as yet, not taken place.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Formatting</h4>
          <p>The schema attempts to follow the spirit of XML, with formatting separated from structure, so almost all formatting is implied. That is, it is the job of a an application to apply the formatting dependent upon the document type and the context of the content it is rendering.</p>
          <p>The following inline formatting elements are available for the emphasis of text:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <code>&lt;Strong&gt;</code> element denotes text with strong importance. An application will normally render the enclosed text in <strong>bold</strong>.</li>
            <li>The <code>&lt;Emphasis&gt;</code> element denotes text with emphasis. An application will normally render the enclosed text in <em>italics</em>.</li>
            <li>The <code>&lt;SmallCaps&gt;</code> element denotes text to be displayed in <span style="font-variant: small-caps">small caps</span>.</li>
            <li>The <code>&lt;Underline&gt;</code> element denotes <u>underlined</u> text.</li>
            <li>The <code>&lt;Inferior&gt;</code> element denotes <sub>subscript</sub> text.</li>
            <li>The <code>&lt;Superior&gt;</code> element denotes <sup>superscript</sup> text.</li>
            <li>The <code>&lt;Expanded&gt;</code> element denotes <span style="letter-spacing:0.5ch">expanded</span> text. (The legislation.gov.uk website currently renders this in <i>italics</i> instead)</li>
            <li>The <code>&lt;Uppercase&gt;</code> element denotes <span style="text-transform:uppercase">uppercase</span> text.</li>
            <li>The <code>&lt;Strike&gt;</code> element denotes <s>struck through</s> text.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The strong/emphasis approach allows an author to key with only the knowledge that they want to highlight the text in some manner without needing to worry about how it will be formatted. To aid developers who wish to render documents in their application in the style of the Queen’s Printer version of the legislation (the printed copy), <a href="appendix-b-implied-formatting-and-text">Appendix B</a> provides tables of implied formatting and implied punctuation/text.</p>
          <p>The full emphasis model of the schema is shown below:</p>
          <ci:include href="schemaLegislationTypes_xsd.html" xpath="cm:getImageFromTitle(.,'EmphasisBasic')"/>
          <!-- Commenting this out as I can't find any evidence that this is actually how legislation.gov.uk treats these elements....
               <p>The <code>&lt;Strong&gt;</code> and  elements act as toggles – that is they will reverse the formatting being applied at that point, i.e. in a bold heading, <code>&lt;Strong&gt;</code> would make the text not bold (roman). This is more desirable than, say, using <code>&lt;Bold&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Italic&gt;</code> which would appear to imply explicit formatting, i.e. <code>&lt;Strong&gt;</code> used in a bold heading would still be bold – in which case a tag such as <code>&lt;Roman&gt;</code> would be needed. The bold/italic approach seems to imply that an author needs to know how an element will be formatted which goes against the separation of structure from formatting and can cause terrible confusion when the same mark-up is formatted different ways with different documents (or even within the same document).</p>
             <p>For more details, see the <a href="schemaEmphasis_xsd.html#Strong">Strong</a> and <a href="schemaEmphasis_xsd.html#Emphasis">Emphasis</a> entries in the Schema Reference Guide.</p>
             <p>If <code>&lt;Strong&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Emphasis&gt;</code> is nested inside itself then it would negate itself.</p>
             <p>If a formatting element is nested within another instance of the same formatting element, the child element negates the effect of the parent element. <code>&lt;Inferior&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Superior&gt;</code> are slightly different in that nesting the elements produces second-level inferior or superior text – it does not negate the initial effect.</p>-->

        <h3>Signatures</h3>
        <p>Signatures occur routinely in secondary and EU origin legislation. Very rarely, an item of primary legislation may have a signature, although in practice these only occur in a schedule. The container for the signatures is a <code>&lt;SignedSection&gt;</code> element (see the <a href="schemaLegislationSignature_xsd.html#SignedSection">SignedSection entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>). This can contain one or more <code>&lt;Signatory&gt;</code> elements. A signatory is one or more persons connected for some reason (i.e. by department). Each <code>&lt;Signatory&gt;</code> element can contain a <code>&lt;Para&gt;</code> element and then one or more <code>&lt;Signee&gt;</code> elements for each signee of the document. It may also have a <code>Date</code> and <code>Time</code> attribute to hold the value of the date and time of signing.</p>
        <p>Each <code>&lt;Signee&gt;</code> element has the following structure:</p>
        <ci:include href="schemaLegislationSignature_xsd.html" xpath="cm:getImageFromTitle(.,'Signee')"/>
        <p>The <code>&lt;LSseal&gt;</code> element represents the official seal with which the signee sealed the document. The <code>&lt;Para&gt;</code> element allows the author of a document to add information about the signee (for example, a statement made by the signee, or a statement that the document has been sealed).</p>
        <p>The following are examples of signatures:</p>

        <p>Appendices do not occur frequently. They can appear after the body of the document, after a schedule, or after the schedules (in which case they apply to all the schedules).</p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;Appendix&gt;</code> element (see the <a href="schemaLegislationMain_xsd.html#Appendix">Appendix entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>) must contain a <code>&lt;Number&gt;</code> element, and may also, optionally, contain a <code>&lt;TitleBlock&gt;</code> element. A <code>&lt;Reference&gt;</code> element can be used to refer back to an introducing provision with the body or schedules of the document.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there may also be a table of contents for the appendix, held in the <code>&lt;Contents&gt;</code> element.</p>

        <h3>Abstracts</h3>
        <p>Abstracts are rare (the only regular occurrence is the Appropriation Act). They provide a summary of the contents of the schedules (they are not a table of contents).

        <h3>Earlier orders</h3>
        <p>In a commencement order, the ”earlier orders” table gives a list of commencement orders that have previously brought into force provisions of the same commenced item of legislation. The <code>&lt;EarlierOrders&gt;</code> element (see the <a href="schemaLegislationExplanatoryNotes_xsd.html#EarlierOrders">EarlierOrders entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>) only occurs within commencement orders and is therefore only applicable to secondary legislation. This element may contain a <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code> element and a <code>&lt;Comment&gt;</code> element, both of which normally contain a standard piece of text. The following is an example:</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Explanatory notes</h3>
        <p>An item of secondary legislation may contain an explanatory note, which describes the content of the item and provides information about the impact assessment for the item (if there is one) and any associated documents.</p>
        <p>The explanatory note for an item of secondary legislation is not the same as the explanatory note for an item of primary legislation, nor is it the same as the explanatory memorandum or explanatory document provided with some secondary legislation—for more information on these, see the section on <a href="#explanatory-material">explanatory material</a>.</p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;ExplanatoryNotes&gt;</code> element may contain a <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code> element and a <code>&lt;Comment&gt;</code> element, both of which normally contain a standard piece of text. The title is not needed if it contains the standard text “Explanatory Notes”. If the <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code> element is missing an application should render a title with the words “<b>EXPLANATORY NOTE</b>” (or “<b>NODYN ESBONIADOL</b>” in a Welsh document).</p>
        <p>The following is an example of an explanatory note:</p>

        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p>Many items of legislation contain “forms”, which specify the content, and often the appearance, of a document that a specific process must use. A document will normally include a form as an image, although a form may contain markup in addition to an image or (more rarely) instead of an image.</p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;Form&gt;</code> element denotes a form. The below example is a form that includes an <a href="#images">image</a> using an <code>&lt;Image&gt;</code> element, with reference to an image resource described by a <code>&lt;Resource&gt;</code> element:</p>

        <p>It is possible to control the orientation of the figure in print output using the <code>Orientation</code> attribute. The attribute can take values of “portrait” or “landscape”.</p>

        <p>Additionally a figure can carry an <code>id</code> attribute which acts as a unique identifier for the figure. The format of this identifier should be g<i>xxxxx</i>, where <i>xxxxx</i> is a five digit padded number (for example, “g00010” or “g01353”).</p>

        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
        <p>Mathematical formulae do occur in legislation (although not frequently). They range from very simple to highly complex and can occur inline or as a block element. The schema therefore permits the embedding of formulae in documents using <a href="https://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>. MathML is a W3 standard XML format for marking up mathematics that provides comprehensive support for mathematical notation.</p>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Formula module</h4>
          <p>The mathematics functionality is wrapped up in a module called schemaFormula.xsd, which imports the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/">MathML 2.0</a> schema.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;Formula&gt;</code> element can contain an equation number (although the need for this is very rare), the actual equation, and a <code>&lt;Where&gt;</code> element. The <code>&lt;Where&gt;</code> element contains a key defining or explaining variables that appear in the formula.</p>
          <p>See the <a href="schemaFormula_xsd.html#Formula">Formula section of the Schema Reference Guide</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="maths">
          <h4>How to use mathematics</h4>
          <p>The following is an example of how MathML looks in XML mark-up and its equivalent rendering:</p>
          <img src="img/ug116.png" alt="%N = ((a − A) × 0.28) / M)" class="output"/>
          <ci:include href="uksi-1996-1342-made.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Secondary[1]/*:Schedules[1]/*:Schedule[2]/*:ScheduleBody[1]/*:Part[1]/*:Pblock[11]/*:P1group[10]/*:P1[1]/*:P1para[1]/*:P2[2]/*:P2para[1]/*:Formula[1]/*:math[1][1]" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1342/made/data.xml"/>
          <p>MathML sits in the namespace <code>http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML</code>. It is necessary to declare the namespace in a document that uses MathML. We recommend declaring the namespace locally (as in, on the <code>math</code> element containing the formula) as this allows for the XML fragment to be extracted complete with its namespace information intact.</p>
          <p>You can create MathML equations using an application called <a href="https://www.wiris.com/en/mathtype/">MathType</a>, a subset of which is in embedded into Microsoft Word. As of January 2023, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML#browser_compatibility">all major browsers now support native MathML rendering</a>. For older browsers there are alternatives, such as embedding the <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> library in a webpage or application, or converting MathML to a GIF, PNG or SVG image. Additionally, for XSL:FO output, <a href="https://www.antennahouse.com/">Antenna House</a> have a MathML plug-in for their “XSL Formatter” software.</p>
          <p>To aid rendering of mathematics until MathML support is more widespread, it is possible to use a <a href="#versions">version</a> to hold an image of the formulae. The fragment below is an example of how a display formula can reference an alternate version with the <code>AltVersionRefs</code> attribute:</p>
          <ci:include href="uksi-2014-2848-made.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Secondary[1]/*:Body[1]/*:Part[4]/*:Chapter[3]/*:P1group[1]/*:P1[1]/*:P1para[1]/*:P2[2]/*:P2para[1]/*:Formula[1]" xpathStopAfter="*:math/*:mrow[1]/*:mfrac[1]/*:mrow[1]/*:mn[1]" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2848/made/data.xml"/>
          <p>In the <code>&lt;Versions&gt;</code> section of the document, place the following mark-up (the Description attribute is optional).</p>
          <ci:include href="uksi-2014-2848-made.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Versions/*:Version[@id='v00002']" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2848/made/data.xml"/>
          <p>In turn this references a resource (from the <code>&lt;Resources&gt;</code> section of the document) that would be marked up as:</p>
          <ci:include href="uksi-2014-2848-made.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Resources/*:Resource[@id='r00002']" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2848/made/data.xml"/>
          <p>For inline mathematics the same can be achieved by using a <code>&lt;Span&gt;</code> element (a generic inline container with an identifier that can be targeted). For example:</p>
          <ci:include href="uksi-2014-2848-made.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Secondary[1]/*:Body[1]/*:Part[6]/*:Chapter[2]/*:P1group[5]/*:P1[1]/*:P1para[1]/*:P2[2]/*:P2para[1]/*:P3[2]/*:P3para[1]/*:Text[1]/*:Span[1]" xpathStopAfter="*:math/*:mrow[1]/*:mrow[1]/*:mo[1]" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2848/made/data.xml"/>
          <p>This again references the <code>&lt;Versions&gt;</code> section of the document:</p>
          <ci:include href="uksi-2014-2848-made.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Versions/*:Version[@id='v00003']" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2848/made/data.xml"/>
          <p>And again this references a resource from the <code>&lt;Resources&gt;</code> section.</p>
          <ci:include href="uksi-2014-2848-made.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Resources/*:Resource[@id='r00003']" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2848/made/data.xml"/>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Formula explanatory text</h4>
          <p>The <code>&lt;Where&gt;</code> element (if present) contains explanatory text for the variables used within the formula, which is common in legislation. The contents may be laid out in a list format using a <a href="#key-lists">key list</a>, although this is rare in new legislation.</p>
          <p>The following is an example of the XML mark-up:</p>
          <img src="img/ug105.png" alt="(3) If S is greater than the individual's adjusted total income for the year (“ATI”), the actual amount on which relief for the year is to be given in respect of a relievable amount is given by “(ATI / S) × L” where—S is the total obtained by identifying the amount that is L for each relievable amount and then finding the total of the amounts identified, and L has the same meaning as in subsection (2)." class="output"/>

        <h3>Resources</h3>
        <ci:include href="schemaResources_xsd.html" xpath="leg:getAnnotationsFromIdWithWrap(.,'Resources','','')"/>
        <p>The following example shows how an SVG resource held internally as XML would be marked up:</p>
        <ci:include href="uksi_19961686_en.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Resources" xpathStopAfter="*:Resource[1]/*:InternalVersion[1]/*:XMLcontent[1]/*:svg[1]/*:metadata[1]/*:variableSets[1]/*:variableSet[1]" fileref="Example taken from uksi_19961686_en (not currently available online in this form)"/>
        <p>The <code>&lt;XMLcontent&gt;</code> element is used to indicate that the content is in XML format. Note that this content does not get parsed.</p>
        <p>An internally held resource may also be held in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64</a> format, which allows raw binary files to be stored as text. This is done using the <code>&lt;BinaryContent&gt;</code> element. The obvious advantage of holding resources internally is that when transporting a file there are no external files to worry about. A Format attribute can be used to give a hint to a processing application as to the format of the encoded data. The possible values are the same as described for <code>&lt;ExternalVersion&gt;</code> below.</p>
        <p>If it is held externally the <code>&lt;ExternalVersion&gt;</code> element can be used. The location of the resource is held in the URI attribute, which should contain a URI. An example is given below:</p>
        <ci:include href="uksi_20051643_en.xml" xpath="/leg:Legislation/leg:Resources/leg:Resource[@id='r00001']" fileref="Example taken from http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/1643/schedule/1/paragraph/1/made/data.xml"/>

      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Versions</h3>
        <p>The schema allows a document to describe “versions” of parts of the document content. The schema allows a document to hold an unlimited different number of versions of practically any piece of the document. This supports the following use cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A drafter may make the document more accessible by providing alternative formats for parts of the document, such as raster images of XML content such as MathML formulae, or an audio description or translation of a paragraph of text.</li>
          <li>An editor may create one or more “concurrent versions” of part of the document when applying an amendment, so that where an amendment applies to a smaller geographical extent than the amended provision, there can be a concurrent version for each extent with only the amendments that apply to that extent.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Alternative formats and languages</h4>
          <p>A <code>&lt;Version&gt;</code> element may contain a representation of part of the document in a different format or language. This allows a drafter to make a document accessible to users with different abilities and computing resources, who may not be able to consume all the document content in its original form.</p>
          <p>The most common use of versions for this purpose is to provide raster images of mathematical formulae, which a document normally represents using MathML. Many browsers still do not support MathML (Chrome being the most common browser lacking support), so legislation.gov.uk displays the image version of the formula to a user instead of the MathML version. The original MathML for the formula remains in the document for other uses. (For an example, see the <a href="#how-to-use-mathematics">How to use mathematics</a> section.)</p>
          <p>The schema does support representing an alternate version using a different language, although this is rarely used (English and Welsh dual-language documents, which are the vast majority of multilingual UK legislation, are published in XML as separate English and Welsh versions). For example, below is an extract from S.I. 1994/725 where the explanatory notes appear in both English and Welsh.</p>
          <p>By holding the Welsh version as an alternate version of the English version, the semantic link that it is actually the same piece of text is retained. An application could then output both the English and Welsh version or only one version as required. For example, you can view <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/725/note/made">the explanatory notes for S.I. 1994/725 in English and Welsh</a> on legislation.gov.uk.</p>

          <p>To enable a application to be able to detect the purpose and language of the alternate version the <code>Class</code> and <code>Language</code> attribute can be used to categorise the content.<!-- This value was never used so commenting out: It is expected that the value “notApplicable” will be used where the format is a graphic that has no text and therefore the language is not of importance.--> The <code>Description</code> attribute can also be used to give a textual explanation as the purpose of the version.</p>

          <h4>Concurrent versions</h4>
          <p>A <code>&lt;Version&gt;</code> element may contain an alternate version of part of the document that applies only to a specific legal jurisdiction (also known as an <a href="#geographical-extent">extent</a>) within the UK. For example, below is <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/67/section/6">1985 c. 7, s. 6</a>, which has versions for both England and Wales and for Scotland. Each version has only the amendments that apply in that jurisdiction:</p>

          <ci:include href="ukpga-1985-67-section-6-2007-09-01.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/(*:Primary[1]/*:Body[1]/*:Part[1]/*:Pblock[1]/*:P1group[1]|*:Versions[1]/*:Version[1])" xpathStopAfter="(*:P1[1]/*:P1para[1]/*:P2[1]|*:P1group[1]/*:P1[1]/*:P1para[1]/*:P2[1])" xpathExclude="//(@DocumentURI|@IdURI)" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/67/section/6/2007-09-01/data.xml"/>
          <p>Note the following attributes that indicate to the processing application how to handle the concurrent version:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <code>Concurrent</code> attribute on both versions of the <code>&lt;P1group&gt;</code> element that indicates that they are concurrent versions.</li>
            <li>The <code>AltVersionsRef</code> attribute on the original <code>&lt;P1group&gt;</code> element that indicates the version to use.</li>
            <li>The <code>RestrictExtent</code> attribute on both versions of the <code>&lt;P1group&gt;</code> element to indicate their respective extents.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An application may display concurrent versions together or separately, as appropriate. The legislation.gov.uk website allows a user to filter the view of a document or provision by geographical extent, and will only display the version or versions applicable to those extents. (For example, you can view the version of 1985 c. 7, s. 6 applicable to only <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/67/section/6/england+wales">England and Wales</a> or to <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/67/section/6/scotland">Scotland</a>.) A user can also filter a parent part or the whole document in the same way—the website will then only render the versions of any child parts applicable to that extent.</p>
          <p>Where possible and appropriate, the content within a <code>&lt;Version&gt;</code> should re-use the IDs for the part it represents and its descendant structural elements, so that links to and within that part continue to work when a reader views the document or a parent part with a filtered extent.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Processing versions</h4>
          <p>A part of a document with an alternate version specifies its alternate version or versions in an <code>AltVersionRefs</code> attribute on the element that represents it (such as a <code>&lt;P1&gt;</code> in the above example from 1985 c. 67, or a <code>&lt;Formula&gt;</code> element for a formula).</p>
          <p>By default, an application should output alternate versions adjacent to the main version unless the <code>RestrictOutput</code> attribute is set to “true”. This restriction of output is desirable in some cases but not others. For example, a <code>&lt;Formula&gt;</code> links to a graphical version of an equation that an application may display if it cannot render MathML, and should not be rendered except in that case. Alternatively, some legislation contains bilingual English–French treaties, where the French text is stored in a separate <code>&lt;Version&gt;</code> to indicate that it is another representation of the same content, but both should be output next to one another to match the formatting in the printed version.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that if an alternate version references a <a href="#resources">resource</a>, <a href="#footnotes">footnote</a> or <a href="#commentaries">commentary</a> that the document stores the referenced content in the <code>&lt;Resources&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Footnotes&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Commentaries&gt;</code> section, not within a <code>&lt;Version&gt;</code>. This is true for all out-of-line objects. It also allows multiple alternate versions to reference the same item.</p>
          <p>It should also be noted that the schema does not enforce any validation of the contents of <code>&lt;Version&gt;</code> elements. This is to avoid any clashes of unique id values. This does, however, mean that, if an application is replacing fragments of the document with alternate versions, then the application should parse the document to ensure that the document is still valid (which should always be the case). It would be an incorrect use of the schema to hold a version that would break the document if it replaced the main version.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Included documents</h3>
        <p>The schema only attempts to provide structures to describe primary, secondary and EU legislation. All of these document types do, however, amend or include documents that are not primary, secondary or EU legislation (for example, treaties, forms and other documents).</p>
        <p>Rather than attempt to “shoe-horn” this data into the schema, the concept of “included documents” was created. This is the ability to include another document (possibly from another namespace) at certain points in the document.</p>
        <p>The following is an example of an SI that has “included” text from a treaty in its Schedule:</p>
        <img src="img/ug56.png" alt="SCHEDULE. PART I.

        <p>It can be seen that the numbering and formatting in the Schedule does not conform to that of a normal SI.</p>
        <p>An included document references a resource (see the <a href="#resources">Resources</a> section below) and it can, therefore, be anything that can be held in a <code>&lt;Resource&gt;</code> element.<!-- (PA sadly nobody ever did this) For forms the recommendation would be to use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to mark up.--></p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Footnotes and margin notes</h3>
        <p>There are two constructs available in the schema for notes to the main text: <a href="#footnotes">footnotes</a> and <a href="#margin-notes">margin notes</a>. Footnotes are used in secondary legislation and some primary legislation, and extensively in EU legislation. Margin notes were only used in old primary legislation (pre-2001) to show citations for legislation referenced in the body of the text and are now deprecated.</p>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Footnotes</h4>
          <p>A footnote is a note that is referenced by number within the text and normally appears at the bottom of the page on which the reference appears (or, on legislation.gov.uk, at the bottom of the page). Footnotes are very common in secondary and EU legislation, and appear only very rarely in older primary legislation. A schema document stores its footnotes out-of-line in a <code>&lt;Footnotes&gt;</code> element.</p>
          <ci:include href="schemaFootnote_xsd.html" xpath="leg:getAnnotationsFromIdWithWrap(.,'Footnote','','')"/>
          <p>The <code>&lt;FootnoteRef&gt;</code> element (see the <a href="schemaFootnote_xsd.html#FootnoteRef">FootnoteRef entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>) references a specific footnote within the text of the document. The <code>Ref</code> attribute holds the identifier of the footnote being referenced. It is perfectly acceptable to have multiple references to the same footnote, although this is actually very rare.</p>
          <p>Below is an example of a set of footnotes and footnote references and how they appear in the output legislation page:</p>

          <h4>Margin notes</h4>
          <p>Margin notes are contained in a <code>&lt;MarginNotes&gt;</code> element. Within that, each note is contained in a <code>&lt;MarginNote&gt;</code> element as in the example below:</p>

          <p>The location of the anchor point for a margin note is somewhat arbitrary, as there is no explicit reference to the note in the text of the printed copy. It is the responsibility of the application to render the margin note as closely as possible to the location of the reference.</p>
          <p>Margin notes appear primarily in primary legislation enacted up to the year 2000, and do not appear in primary legislation enacted after that year. They also appear very occasionally in secondary and EU origin legislation.</p>

        <h3>Linking and citations</h3>
        <p>The schema provides two separate linking mechanisms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>internal and external links, which allow linking to parts of the document or to other web pages or resources;</li>
          <li>citations, which provide information about a document that may be used to generate and render a link.</li>

          <h4>Internal linking</h4>
          <p>The schema provides the <code>&lt;InternalLink&gt;</code> element to allow a cross-reference to be inserted to any element with an <code>id</code> attribute. The <code>&lt;InternalLink&gt;</code> element specifies the <code>id</code> of the destination element using the <code>Ref</code> attribute. If required, it is also possible to link to a range by using the <code>EndRef</code> attribute which, again, links to an <code>id</code> attribute.</p>
          <p>If the target for a link needs to be in the middle of text, then the <code>&lt;Span&gt;</code> element can be used to wrap the target text or to provide a point target, with the identifier specified in its <code>id</code> attribute.</p>

          <p>The <code>URI</code> attribute is used to hold the link and can contain any URI. This may be a URL (web address) or a DOI (which should be in URN format, e.g. doi:10.1000/182).</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h4>Citations</h4>
          <p>Citations provide the ability to cite other documents. There are two levels of citation: main citations that refer to the document being cited, and sub-references that link to the main citation (or another sub-reference) to highlight fragments within the cited document.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;Citation&gt;</code> element cites a whole document. It uses <code>Type</code>, <code>Year</code> and <code>Number</code> attributes to identify the target document and refer to the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Primary legislation: the document type, calendar year of enactment and the chapter number. Note that the chapter number is always a numeric value, even when referring to acts with roman numbering, such as local acts;</li>
            <li>Secondary legislation: the document type, year and number of the legislation;</li>
            <li>EU legislation: the document type, year and number of the legislation as specified by the original EU document’s <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/content/tools/eur-lex-celex-infographic-A3.pdf">CELEX number</a>. (The document number in the CELEX number may be different from the one in the title of the document.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additionally, a <code>&lt;Citation&gt;</code> element may have an <code>AlternativeNumber</code> attribute, which indicates an <a href="#alternative-number">alternative number</a> for a cited item of legislation in a different numbering series. For example, an Order that applies to Northern Ireland would have an alternative number of the format “N.I. 11”. Alternatively, for early primary legislation (pre-1963), this may hold the <a href="#regnal-years">regnal year</a> e.g. “7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2”. The schema provides a number of other “alternative number” attributes (e.g. <code>CommencementNumber</code>), but these are not currently present in published legislation and are reserved for future use.</p>
          <p>Both <code>&lt;Citation&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;CitationSubRef&gt;</code> may also have a <code>URI</code> attribute, which indicates the URI of the document or the part of it that the element cites. Since the launch of legislation.gov.uk, every item of UK legislation published electronically has had a persistent URI pointing to it, as well as a persistent URI for every part and provision within it. Legislation.gov.uk automatically generates these URIs for citations and citation sub-references when publishing a document. It is strongly recommended to use the <code>URI</code> attribute on a <code>&lt;Citation&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;CitationSubRef&gt;</code> when citing legislation to link to the legislation.gov.uk URI of the document being cited.</p>
          <p>An application may render <code>&lt;Citation&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;CitationSubRef&gt;</code> elements as hyperlinks that link respectively to the cited document or to the cited part of the document. (The <code>&lt;Citation&gt;</code> element also has a <code>Locator</code> attribute that was originally intended to specify the URI of the cited resource, but it is deprecated and no longer used in CLML.)</p>
          <p>The following is an example of a citation of an EU document:</p>
          <img src="img/ug111.png" alt="Regulation (EC) No 550/2004: introduction. 19.  Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the provision of air navigation services in the single European sky (the service provision Regulation) is amended in accordance with regulations 20 to 44." class="output"/>

          <!--DOIs never actually used <p>Alternatively, the <code>&lt;Citation&gt;</code> element may also have a <code>DOI</code> (Digital Object Identifier) attribute. Use of this is encouraged where the target document is not available on legislation.gov.uk and has a DOI, as a DOI is persistent and resolution of the DOI is carried out on-the-fly (that is, the location of the target document is stored in a DOI record). A DOI hyperlink will always exist and the resolution process converts this to the actual URL of the document. As long as DOI records are maintained the link will work.</p>-->

            <h5>Citation sub-references</h5>
            <p>The <code>&lt;CitationSubRef&gt;</code> element is now used exclusively in <a href="#commentaries">commentaries</a> to mark up amending and saving provisions in the amending document(s) responsible for the amendment. The following is an example of a citation sub-reference in a commentary:</p>

            <p>The sub-reference links back to one or more main citation references using the <code>CitationRef</code> attribute (normally a sub-reference only links to one main citation, but the attribute permits multiple IDs). A sub-reference may also link to another sub-reference (again using the <code>CitationRef</code> attribute).</p>

        <h3>IDs and XML attributes</h3>
        <p>The <code>id</code> and <code>xml:</code> attributes may appear throughout schema documents. They provide information about the identity, language and formatting of particular parts of the document.</p>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>IDs</h4>
          <p>Many elements in the body of a document may have an <code>id</code> attribute, which contains a unique identifier for that instance of the element. These identifiers serve two purposes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>They identify provisions and structural elements of the document, such as Parts, Chapters and Schedules, which appear in the Table of Contents for the document and which a reader may view independently of the whole document (these IDs are known in the schema as ”P element IDs“);</li>
            <li>They uniquely identify an element so that another element may link or refer to it, or include its contents, elsewhere in the document.</li>
          </ol>
          <div class="section">
            <h5>P element IDs</h5>
            <p>The text of an item of legislation consists of common structural elements, such as <a href="#headings">Parts and Chapters</a>, <a href="#schedules-and-annexes">Schedules</a> and <a href="#provisions-and-paragraphs">sections or paragraphs</a>, that typically have numbers or titles so that a reader can identify them.</p>
            <p>In CLML, these elements may also have machine-readable IDs that identify them. The “augment” process that runs in the Publishing and Editorial systems adds these IDs automatically to structural elements in CLML.</p>
            <p>The legislation.gov.uk website uses these IDs to generate <em>Uniform Resource Identifiers</em> (URIs), which identify both the structural element and the document it is part of. The website uses URIs to refer to documents and their component parts, and allows a user to use the URI for a part to open a fragment of the document in a web browser corresponding to that part. The website also uses the URIs to populate the <a href="#tables-of-contents">Table of Contents</a> of the document.</p>
            <p>These structural IDs normally follow a specific pattern, where the name of the type of element appears first, followed by the number(s) or title that identify it. However, unusual documents may have elements that deviate from this pattern. The following table illustrates the normal pattern for structural IDs for different kinds of elements:</p>

          <h4>XML attributes</h4>
          <p>The standard XML attributes <code>xml:lang</code>, <code>xml:space</code> and <code>xml:base</code> are included on each element, and should be used as defined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace">W3 specifications for the “xml:” namespace</a>.</p>
          <p><code>xml:lang</code> should be used to indicate the main language of the content contained by the element upon which the attribute is appearing. Values should be taken from the ISO 639 standard. This attribute should be used where the language is different from the main language of the document.</p>
          <p><code>xml:space</code> is used to indicate whether white space is significant in the contained content and can contain the value “default” or “preserve”. For a value of “default”, it is left to an application as to how to treat white space.</p>
          <p><code>xml:base</code> was previously used to indicate the base for relative URIs of the document, but is no longer used for this purpose in new data.</p>

        <h3>Tables of contents</h3>
        <p>All items of legislation on legislation.gov.uk have a table of contents (or ToC), sometimes known as an arrangement. (In printed copies, normally only large items of legislation have a table of contents.) The augment process generates the headings, wording and links in the table of contents automatically during publishing and editorial processes and so these should always match that of the document itself. In the past, drafters and editors sometimes manually constructed a table of contents, but legislation.gov.uk no longer uses this approach when publishing or revising legislation.</p>
        <p>There are multiple contents heading structures are available to match the structure of the document. These are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsGroup&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsPart&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsChapter&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsPblock&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsPsubBlock&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsSchedules&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsAppendix&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>EU documents may also use the following structures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsEUPart&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsEUTitle&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsEUChapter&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsEUSection&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsDivision&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;ContentsAttachments&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is also possible to have a table of contents within a schedule or appendix. The approach is the same as the main table of contents, apart from the fact that these tables of contents cannot contain <code>&lt;ContentsSchedules&gt;</code> elements, and a table of contents in an appendix cannot contain a <code>&lt;ContentsAppendix&gt;</code> element.</p>
        <p>It can be seen from the example below that each <code>&lt;ContentsItem&gt;</code> element contains <code>&lt;ContentsNumber&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ContentsTitle&gt;</code> elements. This principle of number and title elements applies to all elements in the table of contents hierarchy (although that is not to say they must be used).</p>
        <p>Each table of contents item may have the following attributes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <code>ContentRef</code> attribute, which contains the ID of the element to which the contents item relates. All documents should make use of this approach to link entries in the table of contents to the corresponding part of the document;</li>
          <li>In revised legislation, the <code>RestrictExtent</code> attribute indicates the <a href="#geographical-extent">geographical extent</a> of the part of the document to which the contents item relates.</li>
          <li>On legislation.gov.uk, the <code>IdURI</code> attribute of a contents item links to the <a href="#identifier-and-document-uris">identifier URI</a> of the corresponding part of the document.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below is an example of a table of contents from the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2021/5">Ministerial and other Maternity Allowances Act 2021</a> (c. 5):</p>
        <ci:include href="ukpga_20210005_en.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Contents" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2021/5/contents/made/data.xml"/>
        <p>The table of contents appears in the print version as follows:</p>
        <img src="img/ug112.png" alt="CONTENTS. Crossheading: Ministerial maternity allowances. 1. Payment of maternity allowance: Ministerial office. 2. Ministerial leave: amount and payment of allowance. 3. Ministerial leave: other provision. Crossheading: Opposition maternity allowances. 4. Payment of maternity allowance: Opposition office. 5. Opposition leave: amount and payment of allowance. 6. Opposition leave: other provision. Crossheading: Extent, etc. 7. Extent, commencement and short title" class="output"/>
        <p>On legislation.gov.uk, the table of contents appears as a set of hyperlinks, with additional links to navigate to parts of the document not included in the XML for the table of contents. For example, the table of contents for the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/2019/1520">Local Government Finance Act 1988 (Non-Domestic Rating Multipliers) (England) Order 2019</a> (S.I. 2019/1520) appears as follows in the CLML:</p>

        <p>The table of contents above appears on legislation.gov.uk as below. Note the additional links to the “Introductory Text”, “Signature” and “Explanatory Note” parts of the document:</p>
        <img src="img/ug113.png" alt="Introductory Text. 1. Citation, commencement and application. 2. Non-domestic rating multiplier. Signature. Explanatory Note" class="output"/>
        <p>The XML for the text content of S.I. 2019/1520 appears below. Note that the <code>ContentRef</code> for each contents item matches an <code>id</code> of an element in the document content, and the <code>IdURI</code> matches that element’s <code>IdURI</code>:</p>

        <h3>Acronyms and abbreviations</h3>
        <p>Although the use of acronym and abbreviation mark-up does not add anything structurally to the legislation, it does allow for explanations of the use of either of these. This becomes extremely useful with regard to web display of legislation, where accessibility requirements demand that acronyms and abbreviations are expanded out.</p>
        <p>Both the <code>&lt;Acronym&gt;</code> element (see the <a href="schemaAcronymsAbbreviations_xsd.html#Acronym">Acronym entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>) and the <code>&lt;Abbreviation&gt;</code> element (see the <a href="schemaAcronymsAbbreviations_xsd.html#Abbreviation">Abbreviation entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>) function in the same manner. The <code>&lt;Acronym&gt;</code> element normally denotes an initialism (the contraction of a phrase to the initial letters of each of its words), whereas the <code>&lt;Abbreviation&gt;</code> element denotes any other contraction of a word or words. The <code>Expansion</code> attribute holds the expanded version of the acronym or abbreviation.</p>
        <!-- <p>Due to the fact that an acronym or abbreviation can occur frequently within the same document it is only required to mark up the first instance.</p> Not true now because of fragmentation -->
        <p>The following is an example of an acronym from a UK statutory instrument.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Terms and definitions</h3>
        <p>An item of legislation may define terms in one provision that are then used elsewhere in the document. The schema allows for the marking up of these terms as <em>defined terms</em> using the <code>&lt;Term&gt;</code> element.</p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;Term&gt;</code> element surrounds the text of a defined term in the part of the text that defines that term to indicate where the term is defined. For example, <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/2003/1998/article/7/1">article 7(1) of the Road Vehicles (Authorisation of Special Types) (General) Order 2003</a> defines the following terms:</p>
        <img src="img/ug91.png" alt="Interpretation: axles, wheels, axle weights and wheel weights. 7. (1) In this Order—“axle” means any number of wheels in a transverse line; “axle weight” means the sum of the weights transmitted to the road surface by all the wheels of any one axle; “group of axles” means a group of two or more axles that are so linked together that the load applied to one axle is applied to the other; and “wheel weight” means the weight transmitted to the road surface by any one wheel of an axle." class="output"/>
        <p>The defined terms “axle”, “axle weight”, “group of axles” and “wheel weight” appear in the XML as follows:</p>
        <ci:include href="uksi_2003_1998_sld_en.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Secondary/*:Body//*:P1[@id='article-7']/parent::*:P1group" xpathStopAfter="*:P1/*:P1para/*:P2[1]" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/1998/article/7/made/data.xml"/>
        <p>Some legislation documents also contain the <code>&lt;Definition&gt;</code> element, which surrounds the definition of a term. The <code>&lt;Definition&gt;</code> element’s <code>TermRef</code> attribute contains the identifier of the <code>&lt;Term&gt;</code> to which the definition refers. For example, <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/1969/997/article/2">article 2(1) of the Superannuation (Local Government and Approved Employment) Interchange Rules 1969</a> defines the following terms:</p>
        <img src="img/ug92.png" alt="Interpretation. 2.—(1) In these rules, unless the context otherwise requires—“the Act of 1937” means the Local Government Superannuation Act 1937; “the Act of 1948” means the Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1948; “the Act of 1953” means the Local Government Superannuation Act 1953; “accrued pension rights” , in relation to a person in approved employment, means such amount as the pension scheme trustees are entitled under the rules of the approved pension scheme to transfer in respect of that person upon his ceasing to be a member of that scheme; “added years” means—(a) in relation to a person in local government employment, any additional years of service reckonable by him under regulation 12 of the benefits regulations or that regulation as applied by or under any enactment, and includes any additional years of service which, having been granted thereunder, have subsequently become reckonable under or by virtue of any other enactment, and (b) in relation to a person in approved employment, any additional years of service of the nature of the additional years of service referred to in (a) of this definition which have been granted in, or have otherwise become reckonable in, that employment;" class="output"/>
        <p>These definitions appear in the XML as follows:</p>
        <ci:include href="uksi_1969997_en.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Secondary/*:Body//*:P1[@id='article-2']/parent::*:P1group" xpathStopAfter="*:P1[1]/*:P1para[1]/*:P2[1]/*:P2para[1]/*:UnorderedList[1]/*:ListItem[5]" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1969/997/article/2/made/data.xml"/>
        <p>Note that a definition may contain child elements, such as a nested list. An author may represent this by placing a <code>&lt;Definition&gt;</code> element at the start and end of the definition and using the <code>Mark</code> attribute with the values “Start” and “End” to indicate the boundaries of the definition. An example of a definition containing a list appears below:</p>
        <ci:include href="uksi-1959-1250-made.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Secondary[1]/*:Body[1]/*:P1group[3]/*:P1[1]/*:P1para[1]/*:P2[1]/*:P2para[1]/*:UnorderedList[1]/*:ListItem[2]" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1959/1250/made/data.xml"/>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Amendments</h3>
        <p>Legislation is unusual in the fact that much of it is concerned with specifying changes to be made to other documents. This is done via amendments, which state the passages of text to be altered, inserted or removed. When amending text, the new text is “quoted” within the amending document. Not only does primary legislation contain amendments to other primary legislation and secondary legislation contain amendments to secondary legislation, but primary legislation can also contain secondary legislation and vice-versa, and both may contain amendments to EU legislation.</p>
        <p>When formatting documents, the format of the amendment depends on when the document was created. For instance, a new style Act (introduced in 2001) amending an old style Act will format the amendment in the new style. However, for SIs created using the SI template, for instance, most amendments take on the style of an SI.</p>
        <p>To aid in the rendering of amendments, an amendment carries with it information about the document it amends. An application rendering an amendment can then use this information to decide whether to format an amendment in the style of the amending document or of the amended document. An example of a block amendment is given below—the provision in this example substitutes a new definition of “out of jurisdiction appeal” into regulation 1(3) of the cited Regulations:</p>
        <img src="img/ug60.png" alt="3.—(1) In regulation 1(3) of the Decisions and Appeals Regulations (citation, commencement and interpretation) for the definition of “out of jurisdiction appeal” there shall be substituted—““out of jurisdiction appeal” means an appeal brought against a decision which is specified in— (a) Schedule 2 to the Act or a decision prescribed in regulation 27 (decision against which no appeal lies); or (b) paragraph 6(2) of Schedule 7 to the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000 (appeal to appeal tribunal) or a decision prescribed in regulation 16 of the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 2001 (decision against which no appeal lies);”." class="output"/>
        <ci:include href="uksi_20031050_en.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Secondary/*:Body/*:P1group[3]/*:P1[1]/*:P1para[1]/*:P2[1]" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2003/1050/regulation/3/1/made/data.xml"/>
        <p>It can be seen from the details on the <code>&lt;BlockAmendment&gt;</code> element (see the <a href="BlockAmendment_xsd.html#Contents">BlockAmendment entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>) that this is amending secondary legislation (<code>TargetClass</code> attribute) of type “regulation” (<code>TargetSubClass</code> attribute) and is altering the body of the document as opposed to a schedule or table of contents (<code>Context</code> attribute).</p>
        <p>The possible values for the <code>TargetClass</code> attribute are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>primary (for amendments to primary legislation)</li>
          <li>secondary (for amendments to secondary legislation)</li>
          <li>euretained (for amendments to European Union legislation)</li>
          <li>unknown (for all other items or where the amended class is unknown)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <code>TargetSubClass</code> attribute indicates for secondary and EU legislation which subtype the amended document is, as these can have slightly different formatting values. The available values are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>order</li>
          <li>regulation</li>
          <li>rule</li>
          <li>scheme</li>
          <li>resolution</li>
          <li>euregulation</li>
          <li>eudecision</li>
          <li>eudirective</li>
          <li>eutreaty</li>
          <li>unknown</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <code>Context</code> attribute indicates which part of an amended document the amendment changes, which is useful for rendering purposes as the formatting of the main body and schedules of an item of legislation are often different. The available values are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>main</li>
          <li>schedule</li>
          <li>unknown</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <code>Format</code> attribute is used to indicate the type of quotes to surround the amendment. The default value for this attribute is “default” which is generally double quotes. The other possible values are “single”, “double” or “none”. The value “none” is generally used to correct a drafting error where the quotes have been omitted.</p>
        <p>This example also shows the use of <code>&lt;AppendText&gt;</code>. This element is used to indicate that the contents should run on from the end of the amendment (as opposed to starting a new line if a <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> element was used. The only place <code>&lt;AppendText&gt;</code> can be used is directly following a <code>&lt;BlockAmendment&gt;</code> element, although it should be noted that where a <code>&lt;BlockAmendment&gt;</code> element is a direct child of a major structure then it cannot be used (i.e. where a Schedule contains just an amendment). This is because it would not be correct grammatically, as there is no actual sentence to terminate.</p>
        <p>It is also possible in some document types for the amendment to start as run-on text in the previous paragraph. For example:</p>
        <img src="img/ug61.png" alt="Use of computers. 5. In section 2(2) (which defines “relevant enactment”) at the end insert “; or (i) the State Pension Credit Act 2002”." class="output"/>
        <ci:include href="ukpga_20020016_en.xml" xpath="/leg:Legislation/leg:Primary/leg:Schedules/leg:Schedule[1]/leg:ScheduleBody/leg:Part[2]/leg:P1group[2]" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/16/schedule/1/paragraph/5/made/data.xml"/>
        <p>The use of the <code>PartialRefs</code> attribute indicates that the element references are partial paragraphs. If the referenced element is a <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> element and it is the first child of the amendment then this should run on from the previous paragraph to give the effect as in the example above.</p>
        <p>Amendments may be made to just the number or title or a structure, e.g. a part title. Usually these structures form part of a large block of mark-up. To minimise the amount of mark-up necessary to indicate such an amendment two elements exist in the schema: <code>&lt;FragmentNumber&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;FragmentTitle&gt;</code>. To indicate the context in which the amendment is being made a Context attribute is used.</p>
        <p>For <code>&lt;FragmentNumber&gt;</code> the possible values are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Group</li>
          <li>Part</li>
          <li>Chapter</li>
          <li>Pblock</li>
          <li>PsubBlock</li>
          <li>Schedule</li>
          <li>Footnote</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For <code>&lt;FragmentTitle&gt;</code> the possible values are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>P1group</li>
          <li>P2group</li>
          <li>P3group</li>
          <li>Group</li>
          <li>Part</li>
          <li>Chapter</li>
          <li>Pblock</li>
          <li>PsubBlock</li>
          <li>Schedule</li>
          <li>Figure</li>
          <li>Tabular</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An example of a fragment is given below:</p>
        <img src="img/ug62.png" alt="(b)for the heading to Part 1 of the Schedule, substitute the following heading—“Pupils in the fourth key stage;”;" class="output"/>

        <p>A document may also contain inline amendments (represented by the <code>&lt;InlineAmendment&gt;</code> element), which only amend an inline run of text rather than a block structure. An example of an inline amendment appears below:</p>
        <img src="img/ug73.png" alt="(2) In Schedule 2, in paragraph 8 (meaning of “long tenancy”), in sub-paragraph (1)(c), for “as it has effect” substitute “as that Part had effect”." class="output"/>

        <h3>Extracts</h3>
        <p>In some situations an item of legislation quotes material from another document—that is, it contains an extract from another document. To handle this situation, the schema provides a <code>&lt;BlockExtract&gt;</code> element (see the <a href="schemaExtract_xsd.html#BlockExtract">BlockExtract entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>) and an <code>&lt;InlineExtract&gt;</code> element (see the <a href="schemaExtract_xsd.html#InlineExtract">InlineExtract entry in the Schema Reference Guide</a>) elements. Both of these situations are rare in UK legislation, although they occur more commonly in EU legislation.</p>
        <p>The following gives an example of a <code>&lt;BlockExtract&gt;</code>:</p>
        <img src="img/ug63.png" alt="The services referred to in section 218(6B) of the Education Reform Act 1988 are—“services provided in relation to the school or institution or persons attending it which— (a) are provided by whatever means and whether under contract or otherwise, and (b) bring the persons providing them regularly into contact with persons who have not attained the age of nineteen years”." class="output"/>
        <ci:include href="uksi_19981584_en.xml" xpath="/leg:Legislation/leg:Secondary/leg:ExplanatoryNotes/leg:P[3]" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/1584/note/made/data.xml"/>
        <p>As with the <code>&lt;BlockAmendment&gt;</code> element, the <code>&lt;AppendText&gt;</code> may follow the <code>&lt;BlockExtract&gt;</code> element to indicate that the contents should run on from the end of the extract (as opposed to starting a new line, which would be how an application would render the text if a new <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> element was used). The only place <code>&lt;AppendText&gt;</code> can be used is directly following a <code>&lt;BlockExtract&gt;</code> element, although it should be noted that where a <code>&lt;BlockExtract&gt;</code> element is a direct child of a major structure then it cannot be used (i.e. where a Schedule contains just an extract). This is because it would not be grammatically correct as there is no actual sentence to terminate.</p>
        <p>It can be seen that this example is an extract from an Act. To indicate the source of the extract both elements carry <code>SourceClass</code>, <code>SourceSubClass</code> and <code>Context</code> attributes. Additionally they also carry a Format attribute.</p>
        <p>The possible values for the <code>SourceClass</code> attribute are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>primary (for items being described as primary legislation)</li>
          <li>secondary (for items being described as secondary legislation)</li>
          <li>euretained (for items being described as European Union legislation)</li>
          <li>unknown (for all other items)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the <code>SourceSubClass</code> attribute the values are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>order</li>
          <li>regulation</li>
          <li>rule</li>
          <li>scheme</li>
          <li>resolution</li>
          <li>euregulation</li>
          <li>eudecision</li>
          <li>eudirective</li>
          <li>eutreaty</li>
          <li>unknown</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the <code>Context</code> attribute the values are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>main</li>
          <li>schedule</li>
          <li>unknown</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <code>Format</code> attribute is used to indicate the type of quotes to surround the amendment. The default value for this attribute is “default” which is generally double quotes. The other possible values are “single”, “double” or “none”. The value “none” is generally used to correct a drafting error where the quotes have been omitted.</p>

        <h3>Provisos</h3>
        <p>A proviso is a clause that qualifies or restricts the validity of the preceding provision. For example, the proviso in the following section clarifies when payments should be treated as mineral royalties:</p>
        <img src="img/ug70.png" alt="2. Subject to Regulation 3 below, where a payment is made on or after 6th April 1970 in respect of a sum receivable on or after that date under an agreement which relates both to the winning and working of minerals and to other matters, then, not withstanding any allocation of the payment under the terms of the agreement, so much but no more of the payment is to be treated for the purposes of the principal section as mineral royalties as might reasonably have been expected to be provided for by the agreement if—(a) it conferred only the right to carry out specified operations in relation to minerals in or under the land to which the agreement relates; and (b) any buildings, structures, roads, shafts, adits or other works existing on the land at the time when the agreement was granted or made were not in existence. Provided that no such payments are to be treated as mineral royalties unless minerals in or under the land are being or have been won and worked pursuant to rights conferred by or under the agreement, or there is reasonable prospect of their being so won and worked." class="output"/>
        <p>The proviso may be a single sentence, as in the above example, or a complex structure with sub-provisions or list entries.</p>
        <p>A simple proviso normally appears as a single <code>&lt;Proviso&gt;</code> element wrapping the proviso’s text. The <code>&lt;Proviso&gt;</code> element does not support nested structure, so more complex provisos use a pair of <code>&lt;Proviso&gt;</code> elements, one at each end, annd with a Mark attribute to indicate which (i.e. a single empty instance of <code>&lt;Proviso&gt;</code> at each end of the proviso, the first with <code>Mark="Start"</code> and the second with <code>Mark="End"</code>).</p>

      <h2>Part 5—Metadata</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <!-- e-GMS doesn't really seem to be used or referenced anymore - don't think there more up-to-date govt metadata specs for us to use, most seem related to tabular data...  
             <p>The metadata for legislation will comply with the <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/egms-metadata-standard.pdf">e-Government Metadata Standard</a> (e-GMS), which is currently at version 3.1.</p>-->
        <p>The schema uses open standards where available to encode metadata. The schema uses <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> elements to store standard metadata, while for legislation-specific metadata the legislation metadata namespace <code>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/namespaces/legislation</code> is used.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Regnal years</h3>
        <p>It is first pertinent to give an explanation of regnal years, which are used to date early legislation.</p>
        <p>The full official citation for an Act consists of a year and a chapter number. Until the beginning of 1963, the citation of new Acts always used the <em>regnal</em> year, which indicates the year (or years) of the monarch’s reign during which the legislature passed the Act. (Note that this was true for the UK Parliament and all its predecessors, except for the Old Scottish Parliament).</p>
        <p>For example, 7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2 represents the 7th and 8th year of Elizabeth II’s reign—that is, a session of Parliament running from 1959&#8211;1960. The chapter number is a running number given to Acts passed during a year and is given in the form c. 33. A new series of numbers starts at the beginning of every session. Thus 7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2, c. 33, represents the 33<sup>rd</sup> public Act passed in the 7th&#8211;8th year of the present reign, which was the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/33">House Purchase and Housing Act 1959</a>.</p>
        <p>Since 1963 the numbering of Acts has been simplified and the year stated is now always the calendar year. For example, 1965 c. 74 means the 74<sup>th</sup> Act passed in 1965, namely the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1965/74">Superannuation Act 1965</a>.</p>
        <p>Local Acts are numbered similarly, but the chapter number is in Roman numerals. For example 7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2 c. xxxiii signifies the <!--<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukla/Eliz2/7-8/33">-->Reading and Berkshire Water Act 1959<!--</a>-->, which was the 33<sup>rd</sup> local Act of that year. Since 1963, local Acts also use the calendar year. For example, 1965 c. xxxi refers to the St. Lawrence, Catford Act 1965.</p>
        <p>In schema document instances, legislation is identified by using the calendar year and number of the document. However, for early legislation it may be necessary to include the regnal year to explicitly identify a piece of legislation, as it is possible for two pieces of legislation from the same calendar year to have the same number.</p>

          <h4>Supersession information</h4>
          <p>The <code>&lt;Supersedes&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;SupersededBy&gt;</code> elements indicate respectively that a document has superseded or been superseded by another document. These elements only appear in secondary legislation.</p>
          <p>There are two circumstances under which a document can supersede another document:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Drafts:</strong> Some secondary instruments are issued in draft, in anticipation of being made as statutory instruments or rules. The body making the instrument may issue one or more drafts of such an instrument before making it as legislation, or may never make the instrument at all. When an item previously issued as a draft is made as legislation, or a new draft replaces an old one, the newer document is said to have <em>superseded</em> the older document.</li>
            <li><strong>Affirmative instruments:</strong> Some statutory instruments are made as ”affirmative instruments“, which do not come into force until approved by a resolution of each of the Houses of Parliament (or a resolution of the Welsh Senedd, for Welsh statutory instruments). Initially, an affirmative instrument is published with no number, and if it is approved it is then published again with a number—the numbered version supersedes the unnumbered one. For example, the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/wsi/2012/1427">Mink Keeping (Prohibition) (Wales) Order 2012</a> was originally published as an <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/wsi/2012/9780348106053">unnumbered instrument</a> before it was approved.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The legislation.gov.uk publishing system automatically generates the appropriate elements when publishing a document and populates them with the URI of the superseded or superseding document. The legislation.gov.uk website automatically populates the other fields (title, type, year, number etc.) from its database when serving a document.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;Supersedes&gt;</code> element has the following structure:</p>
          <ci:include href="schemaLegislationMetadata_xsd.html" xpath="cm:getImageFromTitle(.,'Supersedes')"/>
          <p>The <code>&lt;SupersededBy&gt;</code> element has the following structure:</p>
          <ci:include href="schemaLegislationMetadata_xsd.html" xpath="cm:getImageFromTitle(.,'SupersededBy')"/>
          <p>For example, the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/2012/3048">Disabled People’s Right to Control (Pilot Scheme) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2012</a> was initially published as a <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukdsi/2012/9780111529799">draft</a>. The first draft was later superseded by a <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukdsi/2012/9780111529935">second draft</a>, which was subsequently made as a Statutory Instrument. The initial draft contains the following metadata to indicate that it was superseded by a later draft:</p>

This draft has been replaced by a new draft, The Disabled People’s Right to Control (Pilot Scheme) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2012 ISBN 978-0-11-152993-5" class="output"/>
          <p>The later draft contains the following metadata to indicate both that it superseded the earlier draft and was itself superseded by the made instrument:</p>
          <ci:include href="ukdsi-2012-9780111529935-metadata.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Metadata[1]/(*:Supersedes[1]|*:SupersededBy[1])" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2012/9780111529935/resources/data.xml"/>

            <li>the document is being made to correct or replace one or more erroneous or defective instruments, or</li>
            <li>the document is an erroneous or defective instrument and another document corrects or replaces it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The <code>&lt;Correction&gt;</code> element supports the following attributes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Type</code>—indicates whether the instrument to which this element refers is one that the current document <code>corrects</code> or is <code>correctedBy</code>.</li>
            <li><code>Class</code>—the document type of the corrected/correcting instrument (supports the same values as <a href="schemaLegislationMetadata_xsd.html#DocumentMainType">DocumentMainType</a>).</li>
            <li><code>Year</code>—the year of the corrected/correcting instrument.</li>
            <li><code>Number</code>—the number of the corrected/correcting instrument. If the corrected/correcting instrument does not have a number, the <code>ISBN</code> attribute should be used instead.</li>
            <li><code>ISBN</code>—the ISBN of the corrected/correcting instrument, if it does not have a number.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If the document corrects or replaces any other instrument, it will also contain in its preliminary matter a <a href="#draft-and-correction-headnotes">correction headnote</a> (the &lt;Correction&gt; element in the <code>legislation</code> namespace).</p>
          <p>For example, the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/2006/622">Insolvent Partnerships (Amendment) Order 2006</a> (S.I. 2006/622) corrects <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/2005/1516">S.I. 2005/1516</a>. The <code>&lt;Correction&gt;</code> element in its metadata appears below:</p>
          <ci:include href="uksi-2006-622-made.xml" xpath="/*:Legislation/*:Metadata/*:SecondaryMetadata/*:Correction" source="example" fileref="Example taken from https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/622/made/data.xml"/>
          <p>A very small number of documents include information on the document that corrects them, usually because the print version contains both the corrected and correcting documents. For example, the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/1998/572">Road Vehicles Registration Fee Regulations 1998</a> was corrected by <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/1998/995">S.I. 1998/995</a>, and the <code>&lt;Correction&gt;</code> element in its metadata appears as follows:</p>

          <p>This metadata comes from the “document notice”, an XML resource that EUR-Lex provide for each document they publish. The document notice contains metadata about:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the expression (<code>&lt;EXPRESSION&gt;</code>), or version, in the selected language, which for documents on legislation.gov.uk is always the English version</li>

          <p>The <code>&lt;EnactmentDate&gt;</code> element holds the date of enactment of the legislation using a <code>Date</code> attribute.

      <h2>Part 6—The revised and website content models</h2>
      <p>During the development of legislation.gov.uk, we extended the schema to support revised legislation data—that is, legislation to which editors have added information about commencements, extents and enabling powers, and then brought up to date by applying amendments from later amending legislation. We added the following features to the schema for revised legislation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>revision elements, which mark up insertions into, and substitutions and repeals of, the text;</li>
        <li>fragment attributes, which describe the extent and the dates of validity of parts and provisions of documents;</li>
        <li>a representation of “effects”, which record the details of amendments to legislation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We also extended the schema to support web publication by adding the following features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>identifier and document URIs for documents and their fragments, to indicate the URIs at which they are available on legislation.gov.uk;</li>
        <li>Atom links, to link between different views of each document;</li>
        <li>associated documents and alternative representations, to link from a schema document to alternative representations of the document and to other documents associated with it</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Revised legislation</h3>
        <p>The CLML schema can represent revised legislation as well as original, enacted or made legislation. Revised legislation uses the <code>&lt;Addition&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Substitution&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Repeal&gt;</code> elements (here known as “revision” elements) to indicate changes that have been applied from amending legislation. These elements respectively mark up insertions, substitutions or repeals of inline and block text.</p>
        <p>In revised data, an amendment is marked up with one or more contiguous sequences of <code>&lt;Addition&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Substitution&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Repeal&gt;</code> elements. An instance of <code>&lt;Addition&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Substitution&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Repeal&gt;</code> encapsulates each run of non-whitespace inline text from the start to the end of the amendment (except any within a <code>&lt;math&gt;</code> element, as MathML does not permit foreign markup, so instead the revision element wraps the <code>&lt;math&gt;</code> element rather than its descendant text nodes). Each amendment has a commentary reference shared by all revision elements for that amendment, and a change ID shared across that specific application of the amendment.</p>
        <p>The design of amendment markup in the CLML schema has the following advantages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An amendment can cross block boundaries and different levels of hierarchy, or start or end in the middle of a block, as the sequence of revision elements can start and end at or within any run of inline content;</li>
          <li>An application (such as the legislation.gov.uk website) can distinguish multiple, separate applications of a single effect to a particular provision and point in time (for example, <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/2018/1155/regulation/21/3/b">an amendment that must be applied “in both places in which it appears”</a>), and render opening/closing brackets or other boundaries separately for each amendment instance;</li>
          <li>If a user requests a section or subsection of a legislation document, any part of an amendment that fully or partly overlaps that section or subsection will be present in the returned fragment and will still be associated with the change and commentary IDs for the amendment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When multiple changes affect the same run of text, the relevant revision elements are nested around the affected text, with revision elements for later changes nesting within those for earlier changes. Below is an example of nested revision elements, where an addition contains a nested substitution that in turn contains a nested repeal. Note that in this example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the <code>&lt;Addition&gt;</code> elements that mark the addition of section 10A (amendment <b>F1</b>) encapsulate every run of text within the entire length of section 10A;</li>
          <li>the <code>&lt;Substitution&gt;</code> elements that mark the substitution of s. 10A(1)(a)(b) for words in s. 10A(1) (amendment <b>F2</b>) only encapsulate the runs of text from the start of the substitution in s. 10(1) to the end of s. 10(1)(b);</li>
          <li>the <code>&lt;Repeal&gt;</code> element that marks the limited extent repeal of s. 10A(1)(a) for England and Wales only (amendment <b>F3</b>) only encapsulates the run of text within s. 10(1)(a):</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The legislation.gov.uk website will render the first instance of a revision element for a given change ID with an opening square bracket and the last instance with a closing square bracket. (When applying an amendment, it is therefore important to use a different change ID for each run of text amended, and to use the same change ID across the whole run.) The legislation.gov.uk website will also render a hyperlink next to the amendment to take the user to the associated commentary item.</p>
        <p>In editorial fragments, the revision elements do not encapsulate each run of text, but instead appear in a self-closing form at the start and end of an amendment only. The Mark attribute of each revision element indicates whether the element marks the amendment’s start or end. This convention is much easier for an editor to read and change in the XML source than the text encapsulation convention used in normal revised data.</p>
        <p>(Note that editors normally insert Addition, Substitution or Repeal elements automatically, using a customized XML editor with macros that insert the appropriate revision and commentary elements for each amendment. However, sometimes it is necessary to manually edit the boundaries of an amendment within a fragment, and if the boundary needs to be moved across multiple runs of text it is much simpler to only have to move a single revision element.)</p>
        <p>The Editorial system transforms CLML data between the start/end convention and text encapsulation conventions upon check-out and check-in of a fragment. When an editor checks in an editorial fragment, the Editorial system transforms the amendments within the fragment so that revision elements surround every text node within each amendment instead of only occurring at the start and end. When an editor checks out a fragment, the Editorial system transforms the CLML in reverse, so that revision elements only occur at the start and end of each amendment.</p>

          <h4>Additions</h4>

          <h4>Repeals</h4>
          <p>The <code>&lt;Repeal&gt;</code> element indicates the repeal of a part of the text.</p>
          <p>In recent revised data, a repeal is indicated by a string of dots and a CommentaryRef pointing to the repeal commentary, like the example below from <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/asp/2002/16/section/11/1">section 11(1) of the Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Act 2002</a>:</p>
          <img src="img/ug122.png" class="output" alt="11. Withdrawal of a complaint.

          <p>The <code>&lt;Repeal&gt;</code> element therefore no longer appears in new revised data except to indicate a retained text repeal (where the text is still in force for certain extents or purposes). In legacy revised data, the <code>&lt;Repeal&gt;</code> element is also used to indicate a substitution (with the SubstitutionRef attribute referencing the Addition that replaces the Repeal). Any text within the <code>&lt;Repeal&gt;</code> element will be displayed to the user, unless the text content consists only of a string of dots (which denotes a repeal).</p>
          <p>The <code>RetainText</code> attribute indicates that the text within a <code>&lt;Repeal&gt;</code> is to be retained. This would occur if, for instance, an amendment repeals a run of text for a specific extent or specified purposes only, and that text is still applicable to other extents or for other purposes. If <code>RetainText</code> is set to <code>true</code>, the text within the Repeal element will be displayed to the viewer.</p>
          <p>The SubstitutionRef attribute indicates that new text is to be substituted for the repealed text, and specifies the change ID of the Addition elements containing the substituted text. If both the SubstitutionRef and RetainText attributes are present, the <code>&lt;Repeal&gt;</code> indicates a retained text substitution, where the text is repealed and replaced only for specific extents or specified purposes.</p>
          <p>An example of a retained text repeal using the <code>RetainText</code> attribute appears below—in this example, section 20(2) has been repealed only for England and Wales:</p>

          <h4>Commentaries</h4>
          <p>The <code>&lt;Commentary&gt;</code> element appears in revised legislation and describes an editorial comment on the text of the document. An editor will insert a commentary when they publish the initial revised version of an item with commencement information, or when they carry out an amendment on an item of legislation. A commentary usually explains and cites the authority for an amendment to the text (whether a textual or non-textual amendment), but may also provide other types of editorial information. There are seven annotation types currently in use, which are described below:</p>

        <h3>Fragment attributes</h3>
        <p>On the website and in the revised data, the elements that make up the structure of the document have additional attributes (known as “fragment attributes”) that indicate the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the geographical extent of the fragment;</li>
          <li>the chronological extent of the fragment, that is the dates for which the current version of the provision is valid;</li>
          <li>whether the fragment confers powers to make subordinate legislation;</li>
          <li>whether the fragment contains a “blanket amendment”, which amends an indeterminate set of provisions according to specified criteria;</li>
          <li>the identifiers of the fragment in the preceding Statute Law Database (SLD) system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On legislation.gov.uk, an editor will make a copy of the enacted/made version of an item of legislation and then add extent, commencement and other information to the document. This process is called “initial edit”, and it sets the following fragment attributes on the divisions and provisions of the document:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>RestrictStartDate</code>—indicates the date on which the division/provision comes into force (see <a href="#fragment-dates">fragment dates</a>);</li>
          <li><code>RestrictExtent</code>—indicates the <a href="#geographical-extent">geographical extent</a> of the division/provision;</li>
          <li><code>ConfersPower</code>—indicates a provision that confers power to make <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/secondary-legislation/">secondary legislation</a>;</li>
          <li><code>BlanketAmendment</code>—indicates a provision that contains a “blanket amendment”, which amends an indeterminate set of other provisions of legislation that match the criteria in the amendment;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The editor then publishes this edited version to legislation.gov.uk as the initial revised version. The initial edited version of an item of legislation serves as the base for any future revised versions.</p>
        <p>Although the schema supports fragment attributes on almost all structural elements, legislation.gov.uk only uses them on <code>&lt;P1&gt;</code> and higher levels to reduce editors’ workload and to simplify the data.</p>
        <p>The fragment attributes appear in the following group:</p>
        <ci:include href="schemaLegislationCommonAttributes_xsd.html" xpath="cm:getImageFromTitle(.,'FragmentAttributes')"/>
        <p>An example of a fragment of legislation with fragment attributes appears below:</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h4>Geographical extent</h4>
          <p>The geographical extent of a document (or a part of it) is the set of legal jurisdictions in which that document or part is law.</p>
          <p>Legislation.gov.uk (and CLML) only record extents for legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom (even though some UK legislation extends to other territories, such as the Crown Dependencies). The legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>England and Wales (<code>E+W</code>)—note that England and Wales are not separate jurisdictions, although many items of legislation that extend to England and Wales only apply to either England or Wales;</li>
            <li>Scotland (<code>S</code>);</li>
            <li>Northern Ireland (<code>N.I.</code>).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The <code>RestrictExtent</code> fragment attribute specifies one or more jurisdictions in which the fragment is law, separated by the <code>+</code> symbol (e.g. <code>E+W</code>, <code>S+N.I.</code>, <code>E+W+S</code>). If a fragment does not specify <code>RestrictExtent</code>, a processing application should treat the fragment as inheriting its value from its parent fragment. Note that a <a href="#concurrent-versions">concurrent version</a> of the fragment may exist with a different extent.</p>
          <p>For example, the following fragment contains a part, chapter, cross-heading and section, with each of the first three having a different extent (note that on the website, the extent <code>E+W+S+N.I.</code> displays as “UK”):</p>
          <img src="img/ug130.png" alt="Part III. U.K. Financial Provisions. Chapter I. E+W+S. Council Tax. Different categories of dwellings. E+W. 81 Amounts for different categories of dwellings. E+W" class="output"/>

        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Fragment dates</h4>
          <p>The date attributes on a fragment indicate:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the date from which the current version of the fragment is applicable (<code>RestrictStartDate</code>);</li>
            <li>the date from which the current version of the fragment ceases to be applicable, because it is replaced by a new version (<code>RestrictEndDate</code>).</li>
            <li>the dates at which that fragment exists in the statute book (<code>AltDates</code>), which may be a subset of the <code>AltDates</code> of the parent fragment if the fragment was inserted after the parent provision was enacted/made or inserted);</li>
            <li>the dates at which that fragment is in force (<code>ValidDates</code>) which may differ from the dates at which the fragment exists if it came into force after it came onto the statute book, or if it has been repealed;</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When an editor creates a new revised version of an item of legislation and applies an amendment, the Editorial system generates new <code>RestrictStartDate</code> and <code>RestrictEndDate</code> values for the amended fragment and its predecessor versions to indicate that the new version of the fragment replaces the previous ones.</p>
          <p>For example, the following version of the below section is dated 1/4/2014 and is replaced by a new version on 29/6/2021:</p>
          <img src="img/ug129.png" alt="Transport Act 2000. Changes over time for: Section 19. Version Superseded: 29/06/2021. Alternative versions: 01/02/2001 - Amendment; 20/06/2003 - Amendment; 01/04/2014 - Amendment, Point in time; 29/06/2021- Amendment. Status: Point in time view as at 01/04/2014. This version of this provision has been superseded." class="output"/>

          <p>For recently revised legislation, the <code>RestrictStartDate</code> and <code>RestrictEndDate</code> attributes cascade up the structure of the document—so if an editor amends a fragment, the <code>RestrictStartDate</code> and <code>RestrictEndDate</code> values change for the amended fragment and all of its ancestor fragments, right the way up to the <code>&lt;Legislation&gt;</code> element. However, for older legislation revised in the Statute Law Database, the fragment start and end dates only change for the amended fragment, and not for any ancestor fragments.</p>
          <p>The <code>AltDates</code> and <code>ValidDates</code> attributes are only used internally within legislation.gov.uk and do not appear on API output. The website uses these attributes to generate the timeline and version links.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Other attributes</h4>
          <p>The fragment attributes set contains some other attributes that are either less commonly used in CLML, or are automatically generated by legislation.gov.uk on publication or page generation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>FragmentId</code> and <code>Version</code> refer to the original identifier and version of the fragment from the Statute Law Database, the predecessor system to legislation.gov.uk.</li>
            <li><code>Status</code> indicates that the fragment is prospective (not yet brought into force) or repealed. This attribute is not always present on repealed fragments.</li>
            <li><code>Concurrent</code> indicates that this fragment is one of multiple <a href="#concurrent-versions">concurrent versions</a> of the fragment.</li>
            <li><code>Match</code> indicates whether the current fragment is in force, or whether it is not in force (because it is prospective or repealed). Legislation.gov.uk adds this attribute automatically when generating a page to send to the user.</li>
            <li><code>NumberOfProvisions</code> contains a count of the number of child provisions within the fragment. Legislation.gov.uk adds this automatically when publishing the document.</li>

      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Effects</h3>
        <p>When an item of legislation makes a change to one or more provisions of legislation, our editors record the change in our Editorial system as an <em>effect</em>. An effect is a record of the change that helps our editors track where (and when) to apply amendments and commencements, and helps our readers and data re-users find changes to legislation both before and after we have applied them.</p>

        <p>An effect may also contain other information, such as the titles of the affecting and affected items (<code>&lt;AffectingTitle&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;AffectedTitle&gt;</code>), appended information for the amendment’s commentary (the <code>AppendedCommentary</code> attribute), plus other information used internally within legislation.gov.uk. The effect does not contain the amending text, which appears in an <a href="#amendments">amendment</a> within the body of the amending item, and nor does it encode in any other format how the text or meaning of the amended provision or provisions have changed. The effect does link to the amending provision to allow a reader to consult it themselves.

        <p>For example, <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/116">section 116 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002</a> contains the following amendments (note that according to <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/2">section 2(5)</a> of that Act, “the 1989 Act” refers to the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1989/41">Children Act 1989 (c. 41)</a>):</p>

(2) In section 22 of that Act (general duty of local authority in relation to children looked after by them), in subsection (1) (looked after children include those provided with accommodation, with exceptions) before “23B” there is inserted “17”.

        <p>Our editor read the whole document to identify the amendments and research the context for them, and noted the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/38/introduction/enacted">introduction</a> of the document states that the date of Royal Assent is the 7<sup>th</sup> November 2002, which is the date on which the Act’s provisions come into force unless otherwise stated.</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/section/148/1">Section 148(1) of the Act</a> requires that the Secretary of State must bring the Act into force by order, but excludes section 116. As there is no other provision specifying when section 116 comes into force, section 116 and its child provisions come wholly into force on the date of Royal Assent.</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/38/schedule/4">Schedule 4</a> contains transitory provisions and “savings” (provisions that qualify effects in the Act). <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/38/schedule/4#schedule-4-paragraph-6">Paragraphs 6-8</a> of Schedule 4 all begin with “Nothing in this Act affects”, and so are treated as savings that qualify all effects in the Act.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The editor then recorded the amendments in this section as the following effects:</p>

        <p>Once an editor has recorded an effect from an item, we publish it on legislation.gov.uk. Our Editorial system uses the effects data to generate editorial update tasks for editors to apply the amendments, as well as the commentaries that editors insert when applying the amendments. You can find out more about this process in <a href="#part-7-editing-legislation-in-the-fragment-schema">Part 7—Editing legislation in the fragment schema</a>.</p>
        <p>We aim to apply all amendments promptly, but there is always a large volume of new amendments to apply and so there is normally a delay between publishing the effect and applying the amendment. When a document on legislation.gov.uk has unapplied effects against it, you can view those effects by clicking the “View outstanding changes” link on the red banner near the top of the page, which appears as follows:</p>
        <img src="img/ug90.png" alt="Changes to legislation: There are outstanding changes not yet made by the legislation.gov.uk editorial team to School Standards and Framework Act 1998.

        <h3>Identifier and document URIs</h3>
        <p>Every item of legislation available on legislation.gov.uk has multiple URIs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>an identifier URI, for the item of legislation and each of its parts and provisions (this URI is the same across all versions of a given item, part or provision);</li>
          <li>a document URI, for each version of the item of legislation and each of its parts and provisions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The identifier and document URIs are closely related to the <a href="#p-element-ids">P element IDs</a> that appear on structural elements in a schema document. When a user requests a page from legislation.gov.uk, the website looks up the specified document, and if the user provides a URI for a part or provision (e.g. <code>/section/32/a</code> or <code>/part/III</code>) the database attempts to resolve the URI to the fragment with the corresponding ID in the document (i.e. <code>section-32-a</code> or <code>part-III</code>).</p>
        <p>Legislation.gov.uk also dynamically generates ID and document URIs for each fragment of a document and inserts them into the XML that it returns to the user. It generates these URIs from the P element ID for each element, or using a fixed URI for certain fragment elements that do not have IDs. For example, below is an abbreviated version of the XML for the English web version of <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/wsi/2022/367">the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (Additional Authority) (Wales) Order 2022</a> (W.S.I. 2022/367):</p>

        <h3>Associated documents and alternative representations</h3>
        <p>An item of legislation may be published in multiple formats and alongside other, related documents. Normally, an item published as XML will also have a alternative print representation, which is published online as a PDF. Legislation may also have <em>associated documents</em>, such as explanatory material or impact assessments, some of which may also have their own alternative representations.</p>
        <p>The schema represents all associated documents and alternative representations (except for explanatory material and impact assessments) using an element of the <code>AlterType</code> type. <code>AlterType</code> has the following structure:</p>
        <ci:include href="schemaLegislationMetadata_xsd.html" xpath="cm:getImageFromTitle(.,'AlterType')"/>
        <p>For a full list of the available associated document types, see the <a href="schemaLegislationMetadata_xsd.html#Alter">Alter group in the Schema Reference guide</a>.</p>
        <div class="section">
          <h4>Alternative representations</h4>
          <p>A schema document may be available in formats other than CLML. For example, the UK Parliament supplies Acts both as electronic markup and as PDF.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;Alternative&gt;</code> element indicates that an alternative format is available. The following common attributes denote information about the alternative format:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>URI</code>—the URI for the file containing the alternative format.</li>
            <li><code>Date</code>—the date that the alternative format was published electronically (this may be later than its original publication date; on legislation.gov.uk it will be no earlier than the launch of the website).</li>
            <li><code>Revised</code>—the latest date of the amendments incorporated within the alternative format. Used only for revised PDFs of legislation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example, the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/2017/1325">Terrorism Act 2000 (Proscribed Organisations) (Amendment) Order 2017</a> has both a CLML and PDF version available on legislation.gov.uk. The CLML links to the alternative PDF representation as below:</p>

          <p>A link to the PDF version appears on legislation.gov.uk as follows:</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48">Child Support Act 1991</a> has both an original print PDF and four revised PDFs. The CLML links to the alternative PDF representations as below:</p>

          <h4>Explanatory material</h4>
          <p>Explanatory material may accompany items of primary or secondary legislation.</p>
          <p>Explanatory notes and memoranda may exist both as documents in Explanatory Note Markup Language (ENML, which is based upon the CLML schema) and in other formats, such as PDF. The <code>&lt;Notes&gt;</code> element contains an <code>&lt;Alternatives&gt;</code> element to list alternative representations of the explanatory material.<!--(Annoyingly the CLML doesn't represent these as alternatives but instead as separate OtherDocuments) Explanatory notes and memoranda may exist in other formats. For example, the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/asp/2015/11">British Sign Language (Scotland) Act 2015</a> has <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2015/11/resources">explanatory notes in British Sign Language</a>.--></p>
          <p>A department may correct errors in explanatory material through a correction slip. The <code>&lt;Notes&gt;</code> element contains an <code>&lt;CorrectionSlips&gt;</code> element to list any correction slips applicable to the explanatory material.</p>
          <p>Some items of secondary legislation (specifically, Public Bodies Orders and Legislative Reform Orders) have “explanatory documents” instead of explanatory memoranda. Unlike explanatory memoranda, explanatory documents are statutory documents, required as part of the laying of those two types of Order. Explanatory documents use the <code>&lt;ExplanatoryDocument&gt;</code> element, which follows the <code>AlterType</code> format.</p>
          <p>For example, the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/asp/2005/10">Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005</a> has an Explanatory Note available as ENML and PDF, with a correction slip to the Note. This appears in the Act’s metadata as follows:</p>

          <h4>Other associated documents</h4>
          <p>There are a wide variety of other associated documents that may accompany legislation. The schema provides specific elements for many types of associated document, as well as the generic <code>&lt;OtherDocument&gt;</code> element for linking to unusual types of associated document.

      <h2>Part 7—Editing legislation in the fragment schema</h2>
      <p>The fragment schema represents parts of documents (or occasionally whole documents) as “fragments” which an editor may edit using a customised XML editor. When an editor edits a document, they can choose to “check out” a part of the document to edit. The editorial system transforms the part into the fragment schema upon check out, and then back into the legislation schema upon check in.</p>
      <p>The fragment schema reuses almost all of the modules from the legislation schema, but there are some differences between the two schemas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The root element of a fragment is <code>&lt;Fragment&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li>The <code>&lt;Fragment&gt;</code> element cannot contain a <code>&lt;Contents&gt;</code> (table of contents) element.</li>
        <li>A <code>&lt;Fragment&gt;</code> element must contain a <code>&lt;Primary&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Secondary&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;EURetained&gt;</code> container element, but the container element has a much looser content model than it does in the legislation schema, and can contain almost any structural element as a child.</li>
        <li>The root element may also contain a <code>&lt;Tasks&gt;</code> element, which contains a description of the tasks the editor needs to complete on the fragment.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="section">
        <h3>Tasks</h3>
        <p>The <code>&lt;Tasks&gt;</code> element contains information about amendments to be applied to the current fragment.</p>
        <p>The Editorial system generates the task XML on the fly from the effects data in the system when an editor checks out a provision, and includes this in the fragment XML. The task XML contains three components for each amendment that is applicable to the fragment that has been checked out. They are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The affecting provisions;</li>
          <li>The amendment description that is used by the task information pane in the XML editing environment;</li>
          <li>The commentary that will be applied to the fragment XML when the amendment for that task is applied to the document.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When an editor carries out a task, they first copy any amendment text from the amending provisions (if required), select the position to insert the change, select the task to apply and then select the appropriate macro to perform the operation (which will automatically apply the amendment to the data).</p>
        <p>The task XML is only available via the Editorial system to an editor carrying out an update task on a document. To retrieve task XML for a document or provision, an editor must check out that document or provision as part of an update task.</p>
        <p>The following example of task XML is taken from an update task on the Editorial system:</p>

      <h2>Appendix A—Implied formatting and text</h2>
      <p class="para"><span>The legislation schema attempts to follow the practice of excluding formatting from the markup where possible. However, this means that for the rendering of documents the formatting is implied by the document type. That is a P1group title will render differently in an Act Schedule from an SI body for example.</span></p>
      <p class="para"><span>In addition to this, punctuation and characters that are essentially formatting are omitted from the XML.</span></p>
      <p class="para"><span>To aid the rendering of schema documents the following tables provides information on the implied punctuation/characters and formatting for the different types of document that can be stored in the schema. This implied rendering reflects the original printed Queens Printers copy and, in almost all cases, the formatting on legislation.gov.uk.</span></p>
      <p class="para"><span>This should also help with converting data into schema format, where data that has hard-wired formatting information will need the information stripping.</span></p>
      <p class="para"><span>The schema uses formatting such as Strong and Emphasis to imply exactly that it does not specifically state bold or italic. However, in practical terms Strong does equate to bold and Emphasis does equate to italic. Therefore if Strong occurs in an implied bold heading for instance that would actually render the text not bold (or roman).</span></p>
